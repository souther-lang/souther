/**
 * That the shapes these measurements are taken against still compile.

 * <p>{@link CorpusTest} makes this claim about the sources carried in this module. The generated
 * ones had nobody making it, and they are the arrangement most of the reasoning here rests on: a
 * language change that leaves one of them behind leaves a measurement being taken of a compile that
 * stops early, which is faster than one that finishes and reads as an improvement. Nothing about a
 * timing says which of the two it timed.
 *
 * <p>At small sizes. What is asked here is whether the shape is admissible, and a shape that is
 * admissible at ten modules is admissible at two hundred — the sizes are what the measurement varies
 * and are no part of this. Held small on purpose: a test that took as long as the benchmark would be
 * a benchmark, and would stop being run.
