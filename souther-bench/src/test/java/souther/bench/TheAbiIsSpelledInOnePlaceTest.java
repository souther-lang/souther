/**
 * Nothing outside {@code souther.compiler.jvm} assembles the name of a class this compiler invents.
 *
 * <p>The guarantee this backs up is held by the type system, not by this test: a
 * {@link souther.compiler.jvm.JvmClassName} can only be made inside that package, so no reader can
 * produce a generated-class identity of its own. What the type system cannot stop is a caller
 * building a plain {@code String} that happens to be one of those names and handing it to a class
 * loader or an {@code equals}. That is what this looks for, and it is a tripwire rather than the
 * invariant: it does not have to be complete to be worth having.
 *
 * <p>It reads the constant pool rather than the source, because a joint is visible there and prose is
 * not. {@code module + "." + member.name() + "Case"} compiles to a string-concatenation recipe in
 * which every argument stands as U+0001, so the recipe holds a {@code Case} with a joint right before
 * it and a sentence that merely says the word Case does not. So
 * the general words this ABI uses can be looked for without catching every diagnostic that mentions
 * them.
 *
 * <p>The spellings are not listed here. They are asked of the ABI — the difference between what a
 * derived class is called and what it is derived from is the suffix, whatever the suffix currently is
 * — so a naming scheme changed there does not leave this looking for the old one.
 *
 * <p>It lives in the last module the reactor builds, because it reads every module's classes and they
 * have to be there. The module list is asserted, so a reactor reordered later cannot quietly shrink
 * what is covered.
