/**
 * One method introduces a measure's answer, and nothing else makes a case of one.
 *
 * <p>Every measure's {@code of} is the rule: what a measure
 * came to follows from what it found and whether its own reading ran out, and those two facts
 * arrive together or not at all. A caller writing {@code new Complete(entries)} decides it from the
 * entries alone, which is the reconstruction the type exists to stop — and is what every reader did
 * while the answer was a list beside a status.
 *
 * <p>The type cannot forbid it. {@code Absent} takes the proof that its own measure's reading ran
 * out, and only the reading can make one; {@code Complete} claims the same thing and carries
 * entries instead, so a case public enough to match on is public enough to write. A proof on
 * {@code Complete} as well would close it, at the price of every fixture that wants a measure made
 * in full needing a reading to have made one — which the tests that fabricate a border to hold a
 * criterion to cannot pay. So this is the whole of what enforces the rule.
 *
 * <p>Which is why it asks {@link Compiled} rather than reading the classes itself. Making a value is
 * three things in bytecode and not one, and a check that knew about {@code new} alone would be
 * passed by a constructor reference — the vocabulary belongs in the one place that has it, not in
 * each check that needs it.
 *
 * <p><b>By the method, with its parameters.</b> The rule names {@code of}. Counted per class, a
 * helper beside it would keep the class's total where it was and answer for nothing; counted per
 * name, an overload would be admitted without anybody deciding it should be.
