/**
 * The partitioning stage reads what a position is; it never works it out again underneath.
 *
 * <p>What a value is made of has one answer, and the stage had it four ways over: from the reading
 * of a position, from the declaration through its field types, from a collection constructor taken
 * apart by hand, and from a walk reaching through the names a value is written under. Four readings
 * of one fact agree wherever they happen to stop at the same depth and part everywhere else — at a
 * sum, at a name over a name, inside a container — and each parting was a defect found separately.
 *
 * <p><b>So this is about reachability and not about a vocabulary.</b> A rule naming the ways
 * anybody had written it down so far would be passed by the next one written another way, and that
 * is the failure this exists after rather than a hypothetical: the walk it removed reached the
 * declaration through an accessor no earlier rule watched. What is checked is that no path from the
 * stage arrives at raw structure at all, however many methods it goes through and whatever those
 * methods return. A helper handing back a {@code boolean} hides nothing here, because what is
 * followed is the call and not the answer.
 *
 * <p>Over the calls as written, which is the shape of what this claims. A method reached only
 * through an interface has no edge here, so a seam of that kind is held by what is on the far side
 * of it being in the stage rather than by this. Every reading the stage has today is reached
 * through a class a call names.
 *
 * <p><b>What counts as raw structure is the types' own statement.</b> {@link
 * souther.compiler.types.Type.Leaf} says it holds no type inside it and {@link
 * souther.compiler.types.Type.Compound} says it is built out of others, so taking a compound apart
 * is reading structure and reading the name off a {@code Ref} is not — a {@code Ref} has no
 * structure to read, which is what makes it a leaf. {@link souther.compiler.ast.Hir.Def} permits
 * the declarations, so reaching one of those is reading what a module wrote. Both sets are derived
 * from the sealed hierarchies rather than listed here, and a constructor added to either joins them
 * without anybody remembering to.
 *
 * <p><b>The table is of authorities, and that is the point.</b> Each is a place that owns a
 * question, reads whatever raw material that question needs, and hands back an answer. It is not a
 * list of methods allowed past the boundary — it is why the stage does not need to look past it. A
 * method reaching raw structure that no authority answers for is a second reading of something
 * already decided, whatever it is called.
 *
 * <p>What the walk itself does is held by {@link ThisReadingSeesAReadingOfRawStructureTest}, which
 * hands it code written to be read. Green here says the compiler is clean; green there says this
 * would have gone red had it not been.
