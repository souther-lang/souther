 * code of every class the reactor built, and the walk allocates a site for every call, field access
 * and case there is. Read per check, that is the same decoding over and over on classes that were
 * already parsed.
 *
 * <p>Counted rather than compared. What these hold is a site for every call the reactor's code
 * makes, and a check asking whether it was handed the same list twice says so by printing both of
 * them. How many times one was worked out is the same fact in a number.
