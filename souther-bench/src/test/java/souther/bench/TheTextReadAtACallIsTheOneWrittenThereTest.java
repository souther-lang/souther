/**
 * What {@link Compiled.Invocation} reads at a call is the text written at it, and nothing else.
 *
 * <p>The rules over a document's named fields find their writers by that text, so a call this reads
 * a name at that was not written there is a writer counted for a field it does not write — and a
 * call it reads nothing at is a writer no rule about that field ever sees. The second is the worse
 * of the two: a check whose population can shrink in silence goes on looking complete.
 *
 * <p>So this holds the reading to both halves, over calls written here for the purpose. What it is
 * not is a claim that an argument can be recovered in general: running the program is what does
 * that, and a rule written as though this did it would be a rule about a guess.
