/**
 * A field a document decides the order of is written from a sequence somebody put in order.
 *
 * <p>What the orders themselves cannot say. A method that starts an array and walks a collection
 * into it publishes whatever that collection iterates in, and there is nothing in the array or in
 * the collection to say so — the document comes out looking the same until something upstream is
 * tidied, and then it comes out different for a reason no diff explains.
 *
 * <p><b>Which fields, read off what was declared and not off the schema.</b> Whether an array's
 * order is this compiler's or the model's is a fact about the contract rather than about the shape
 * of the field, so it is written down where the orders are
 * ({@link PublicationOrders#CANONICALLY_ARRANGED_FIELDS}). Read off the schema instead, this would
 * be asking every array of the document to be sorted, which is false of the ones whose order is the
 * order somebody wrote — and a check making that demand would be met by sorting them.
 *
 * <p>So the arrays whose order is somebody's own are outside this on purpose, and
 * {@link #anArrayWhoseOrderIsNotThisCompilersIsOutsideThis} is what says the population really does
 * leave them out rather than happening to contain no counterexample.
