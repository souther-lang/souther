/**
 * Every figure this compiler stops a search at is read where a rule says it is read, and nowhere
 * else.
 *
 * <p>What a budget is for is being carried: a search that stopped at one says which, and an account
 * that reads it knows the point is open for a reason somebody could raise rather than because the
 * model refuses a row. That only works while every place a figure is reached is a place that hands
 * it over — a walk that consults one and comes back with a word alone is a stop that vanished, and
 * the word it comes back with is written wherever a walk stops for any reason at all, so nothing
 * downstream can tell that it happened.
 *
 * <p><b>So the places are counted rather than trusted.</b> Twice while this was written the list of
 * budgets was taken from the constants that looked like budgets, and twice it was short — once by a
 * figure spelled differently and once by a figure that is the size of a walk rather than a number
 * anybody wrote down. A name is not what makes a budget; being reached and stopping something is.
 *
 * <p>Each entry below says what that place does with the figure. A place added is a question, and
 * it has three answers rather than two: the place hands the budget over, or what it hands over is
 * carried somewhere else, or reaching the figure omits no work at all and there is nothing to carry.
 * The answer belongs beside the code that decides, which is why the list is here and not a count.
 *
 * <p><b>The third is an answer and not an excuse.</b> A figure whose channel is simply missing and
 * one that gives nothing up look alike from here — both are read and neither travels — and the
 * difference is the whole of whether a reader is owed something. So a place claiming it has to say
 * why nothing is lost, and the sentence has to be one somebody could find wrong.
 *
 * <p><b>One of two sheets.</b> A figure a class copies into a field of its own is reached once,
 * where the field is set, and the walk that then stops at the field is not a reader of the figure
 * here — so this holds the registered figures to being handed over, and
 * {@link EveryFigureTheComposingStageStopsAtIsABudgetOrIsSaidNotToBeTest} holds the classes to
 * registering a figure at all. Neither is enough alone: that one sees a number written down and
 * this one sees a figure that is the size of a walk.
 *
 * <p><b>And what neither sees is the predicate.</b> Each entry below says the place hands the
 * figure over; that the place reaches it only where there was more to do is not something either
 * sheet can read. What says that is the threshold tests, one either side of a figure and on it, and
 * they exist for the walks that can be put there.
