/**
 * What the reactor builds, asked once.
 *
 * <p>The checks in this module are about the repository rather than about one build, so each of
 * them needs the same two answers: which modules there are, and where their classes ended up. Each
 * had worked them out for itself, and four copies of "which modules there are" is four places for
 * one of them to stop covering the module added next — which is the shape those checks exist to
 * refuse.
 *
 * <p>The modules come from the root pom, which is what the reactor reads. Named in a list here
 * instead, this would be a copy of the reactor rather than a reading of it.
 *
 * <p>A module with nothing built is a hole and not a pass. A check that walks fewer modules than it
 * claims answers about the ones it read and says nothing about the rest, so this refuses rather
 * than skipping — which is also what makes naming every module a dependency of this one the thing
 * that keeps such a check honest under {@code -am}.
