/**
 * Whose it is to write a row at a point is decided once, and read by two accounts and nobody else.
 *
 * <p>A border owes a row at up to four points, and two of them can be owed to the declarations that
 * drew the line rather than to the body carrying the type. Everything that measures a behavior,
 * counts what it covers, raises a finding about it or offers it a row has to know which of the two
 * it is holding — and while every one of them asked for itself, the one that forgot weighed a
 * behavior's row against another behavior having no rows and held a build undetermined about a line
 * the module's own account had settled.
 *
 * <p>So the question is asked where the point is made, and what comes out of it is one of two arms.
 * This holds the two halves of that: the classifier is called from one place, and the arms are read
 * only by the two accounts made from them. A third reader is a consumer deciding again.
 *
 * <p><b>Gathering the readings of a point is not one of those readers.</b> Which readings are of one
 * point is settled by what the point is, and whose the point is is settled by what settled it — so
 * the two questions are answered in the order they are asked, and a grouping that read the arm would
 * be gathering one kind of point and leaving the other with no value naming its readings. What that
 * leaves here is a merge over the classifier itself, and the arms read where each account begins.

     * there, so asked earlier the answer would be about whichever contributor had arrived, and asked
     * later it would be asked by whoever wanted it. And an arm is named by the two accounts and by
