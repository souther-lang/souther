 * {@code import ...Derivation.Complete} and a bare {@code new Complete(...)}, a line break after
 * {@code new}, a static import, a qualified call — all ordinary Java, and all read past a pattern
 * written for one spelling.
 *
 * <p><b>Three ways, and a check that leaves one out is a check with a way round it.</b> A reference
 * is the call it stands for and puts neither an invoke nor a {@code new} in the caller's code: it
 * arrives as a method handle in the bootstrap arguments of an {@code invokedynamic}. A check that
 * counted only {@code new} would be passed by {@code Complete::new} — which is why this is one
 * place and not a vocabulary each check writes out again. The first check here worked it out; the
 * second copied the module walk and not this, and was evadable by exactly the reference the first
 * one names.
