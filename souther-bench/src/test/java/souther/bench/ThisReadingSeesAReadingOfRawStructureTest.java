/**
 * What the walk over a stage's readings sees, asked of code written to be read.
 *
 * <p>The rule beside this one says the compiler has no path from its partitioning stage to raw
 * structure. That is a fact about the compiler as it stands, and it stays green if the walk stops
 * seeing something: break the collection of one instruction and, with no such path written today,
 * nothing goes red. What the rule protects would be gone and nothing would say so.
 *
 * <p>So the walk is asked here about a model that holds one of everything. Each fixture is a claim
 * a reader can check by reading it — this reaches a declaration, this takes a compound apart, this
 * one only reads a name — and the walk's answer is held against it. A mutation run once against
 * the compiler proves the walk saw a defect that day; this says it still would.
 *
 * <p>The model is written in sums of its own. What the walk is handed is which sum says what a
 * module wrote and which is built out of others, so a model with its own asks whether those sets
 * are derived from the classes it was given rather than known. Written in the compiler's types, a
 * fixture would be checking a spelling.
