/**
 * Every whole number the composing stage is written to stop at is one of this compiler's budgets, or
 * is said here not to be.
 *
 * <p>The second sheet, beside the one that counts where a budget is read. That one holds the
 * registered figures to being carried; this one holds the classes to registering a figure at all —
 * and it is the sheet the population needed. Twice while #1232 was written the budgets were taken
 * from the constants that looked like budgets, and twice the list was short. A name is not what
 * makes a budget.
 *
 * <p><b>Told by how the number arrives and not by what it is called.</b> A figure that comes from
 * {@link souther.compiler.partition.CompositionBudget} is worked out when the class is initialised
 * and has no constant value in the class file; a number written into the source has one. So a
 * constant that is a budget is one nobody wrote down twice, and this is what says so mechanically —
 * a rule about spelling would be passed by the next figure spelled differently, which is the failure
 * that made this necessary.
 *
 * <p>What it still does not see is a figure derived from something other than a number, which is
 * anything worked out rather than written down. Every figure there is is written down as one of
 * this compiler's budgets, so what such a number would be is a bound somebody put beside a walk
 * without registering it — and that one is caught by the other sheet, which sees the enum being
 * read where the walk stops. Neither is enough alone.
