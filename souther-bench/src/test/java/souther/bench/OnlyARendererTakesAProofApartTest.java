/**
 * What decides a policy reads the answer; what writes a sentence writes one payload's words; and
 * what makes an answer is the reading that made it — over every module the reactor builds.
 *
 * <p>{@code Reachability} has three arms and each carries something: why nothing arrives, what says
 * something does, why nothing settled it. A reader that took one of those apart would be deciding
 * an obligation, a diagnostic or a claim on a distinction inside the payload, and a distinction
 * added there later would silently become a change to that decision.
 *
 * <p><b>Every module, because the rule is about the repository and not about one build.</b> The
 * compiler's own copy of this check reads the classes of the module it runs in, which is quick and
 * is all it can do: at the time that module's tests run, nothing downstream has been compiled. So
 * the rule is owned here, where the reactor is finished and every module's classes exist — the same
 * reason this module already reads them all to hold a generated class's name to one place.
 *
 * <p>Read off the compiled classes rather than the sources. The arms being package-private stops an
 * {@code instanceof} and nothing else: a {@code Words} and the factories are public, so a static
 * import, a qualified call or a method reference reaches them, and a scan over text answers about
 * spellings. What the bytecode says — who calls {@code said}, who implements a {@code Words}, who
 * calls a factory, whose code runs a constructor, and what handle a reference put in a bootstrap
 * argument — is what a call is.
 *
 * <p>Both directions are asserted. A check that only counts violations passes when it reads nothing
 * at all, so every rule names what it expects to find and fails where that is missing, and the walk
 * fails where a module the reactor builds has no classes to read.
