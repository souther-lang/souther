/**
 * Nothing works out how far a measurement got except the one place that turns it into a word.
 *
 * <p>{@code MeasurementStatus} is four words for a document. It was also the compiler's own answer
 * to how much of a measure was made, which made it a lattice: every producer worked its word out
 * from a fact it then let go of, and every parent worked the same word out again from the fields
 * beside its children (issue #953). The fix was not to add a field but to leave the word with the
 * only reader that needs one.
 *
 * <p>So this is the rule the change is worth keeping: <b>a measurement is asked what it is, and only
 * a renderer asks what to call it.</b> Held over the compiled classes and over the source, because
 * the two catch different things — bytecode says who reaches what, and source says what somebody
 * wrote down.
 *
 * <p><b>And the defences that are gone.</b> Most of what this replaces was a check over a state the
 * type still let anybody write: a status paired with the wrong reason, a flag beside a status that
 * had to agree with it, a boolean recovering a state the enum had no word for. Each is named here
 * so that reintroducing one is a decision somebody makes rather than a line somebody adds.
