/**
 * A reader that interprets how an arm of a choice was decided names every way there is, and none
 * asks after the one it knows.
 *
 * <p>What decides an arm is a sum ({@code Choice.Decides}), and it is a sum so that a way of
 * deciding added later stops every reader that interprets one until somebody has said what it means
 * there. Nothing but the readers themselves carries that. An exhaustive {@code switch} over a sealed
 * type stops at compile time; the same reader with a {@code default} arm does not, and neither does
 * one written as a chain of {@code instanceof}. All three are legal Java, and only the first has the
 * property the sum was chosen for.
 *
 * <p>Which is not hypothetical. What choosing an arm settles was written as an {@code instanceof},
 * and the ways it did not name were answered "nothing is settled" — so a choice whose arms were read
 * and whose conditions were dropped would have been bounded by a span over values it cannot take,
 * with nothing anywhere saying a reader had been missed.
 *
 * <p><b>The cases named, and not the instruction.</b> This check was first written as "no
 * {@code instanceof} against a way of deciding", which is a rule about the wrong thing: a
 * {@code switch} with a {@code default} compiles to the same {@code invokedynamic} as one without,
 * so the reader that the sum cannot stop reads here exactly like the reader it can. What tells them
 * apart is which cases were named, and that is what is asked. The {@code instanceof} half is kept
 * beside it, because a reader written that way names no case at all and would otherwise be a reader
 * this never looks at.
 *
 * <p>Read off the bytecode rather than the sources ({@link Compiled}): a case is written in as many
 * ways as Java has patterns, and the class it names is one thing in the class file whichever was
 * written.
