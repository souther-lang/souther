/**
 * What a position was left holding is an observation, and no account of a rule is built out of it.
 *
 * <p>An allowance is held per position and every rule reaching one pays into it. So a machine
 * refused while a position's answer was worked out is a fact about the pattern that asked, recorded
 * at the place the spending was arranged by — and a place has as many claimants as it has rules.
 * Projected onto the position and read back, the fact became one about every rule that named the
 * place: an author was sent to a clause that reads perfectly well, and the reason had no place among
 * the parts they wrote for anything downstream to put it back into.
 *
 * <p><b>The projection is not the defect and is not being removed.</b> A position is as wide as it
 * is because a machine was refused, and a reader of the place is owed that. What is held here is the
 * direction: down to a place, never back up to a rule.
 *
 * <p>Read off the call sites, because that is what the rule is about. A shortfall does carry what
 * it is about — the pattern whose machine it is and the position it was being built for — but
 * nothing in a type stops somebody reading the position's face and filing what they find under a
 * rule, which is what was being done.
