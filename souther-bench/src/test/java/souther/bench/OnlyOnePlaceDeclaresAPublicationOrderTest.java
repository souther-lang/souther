/**
 * Who may say what order a plurality of reasons is in.
 *
 * <p>Two orders and two answers, and the asymmetry between them is the arrangement. What order this
 * compiler publishes a kind in is one decision for the whole compiler, so making one is closed to
 * the place that declares them. That a particular sequence is in the order the model has is not a
 * decision at all — it is something a producer either knows or does not — so anybody who knows it
 * may say it, and a reader who does not may not.
 *
 * <p>Read off the call sites rather than off the declarations. A check over the fields of the
 * classes there would see a field of the order's type and miss an order made inside a method and
 * used from there, which is the same second order with nowhere to see it. What makes one of these
 * is calling a method, and this says who calls them.
