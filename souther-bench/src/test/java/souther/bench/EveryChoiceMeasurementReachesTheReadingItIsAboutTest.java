/**
 * That every point the choice measurement times reaches the reading it says it is about.
 *
 * <p>A measurement of a path nothing arrives at reports a number and answers nothing, and the two
 * are indistinguishable in a report: a compile that never settled a choice is quick, and a change
 * that made settling one slower comes back as no change. So each point states which reading its
 * figure would be about, and this runs the points and holds them to it.
 *
 * <p><b>The points, and not shapes written to stand for them.</b> {@link Choices#points()} is what
 * the measurement times and what this walks — one list, one builder, one set of sizes. A test that
 * built its own copy of a shape would be checking that copy: the sizes could part, or the source a
 * series is generated from could change under the series alone, and the reading a figure is about
 * would go unwatched while a reading of something adjacent stayed green. That is the shape of the
 * defect this whole measurement exists because of, one level up.
 *
 * <p>Held against what the compiler says it did ({@link ChoicesRead}) and never against the source
 * text. A count of {@code ||} in a generated string is a reading of the generator, and the generator
 * is the thing that would be wrong: a shape written to state sixty-four alternatives whose reading
 * merges them is exactly the accident, and the text says nothing about it.
 *
 * <p>Nothing here is timed. What the measurements come to on this machine is not a fact about the
 * compiler, and what they reach is. And nothing here is a model this repository carries, so it is
 * not among the population the nightly runs: what it holds is what a change to the reading of a
 * choice would break, which is a thing to find out on the change and not the night after it.
