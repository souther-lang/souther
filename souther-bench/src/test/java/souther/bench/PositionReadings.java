/**
 * Where a stage's calls arrive at raw structure, and what answers for them on the way.
 *
 * <p>What it reads and which classes it reads are two things. The rule about this compiler names
 * the partitioning stage and the compiler's own sums; a check of the reading itself hands it code
 * written to be read, and neither is a copy of the other. A second walk written for the second
 * purpose would be a check of the copy.
 *
 * <p>Everything about the vocabulary is an argument for the same reason. What a declaration is and
 * what is built out of types are stated by the sums the caller names, so the walk derives both from
 * the class files rather than knowing either — and a caller can therefore hand it a sum of its own
 * and see what the walk makes of it.
 *
 * <p><b>What a call is, here, is the receiver it names.</b> A method reached only through an
 * interface, or through an override of the method a call names, has no edge: what is read is the
 * class written into the call and not what stands there when it runs. So the reachability this
 * answers is over the calls as written. Where a seam is an interface, what is on the far side of it
 * is held by being in the stage — or by nothing, which is where this stops being an argument and
 * the reader has to look.
