/**
 * What one compile costs, measured twice because the two numbers answer to different people.
 *
 * <p>Cold is what a build pays: a JVM that has never compiled anything, running the compiler
 * interpreted until the JIT catches up. It is the only compile most invocations of the command line
 * ever do, and it is several times the steady-state figure. It can be taken once per process, so a
 * run reports it for the first corpus only.
 *
 * <p>Warm is what the compiler itself costs once that is paid — the number to watch when a change is
 * meant to make the work smaller rather than the start-up cheaper. It is what a language server
 * spends, and what a build spends per module after the first.
