/**
 * What an edit costs a store that already holds the answers — the latency an author feels between a
 * keystroke and the diagnostics catching up.
 *
 * <p>Re-asking without an edit is the floor: every answer still holds, and what is left is the walk
 * that establishes that. A trailing comment reaches the parse and stops there, because the parse of
 * a file with a comment added at the end is the same parse. Adding a definition changes what the
 * module declares, so it reaches everything that reads the declaration.
 *
 * <p>Each is warmed for as long as it is measured. An edit reaches less code than a compile, so it
 * is slower to reach steady state — a handful of rounds reports a number several times the one an
 * author would see.
 *
 * <p>Which file the definition is added to is most of the answer, so it is added twice: to the
 * first source, which the others import, and to the last, which nothing imports. The two numbers
 * bound what an author pays while typing — the first is the cost of editing the type everything is
 * built on, the second the cost of editing a leaf, and a workspace is mostly leaves.
