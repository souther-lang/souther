/**
 * What the generated code costs to run, as against what it costs to produce.
 *
 * <p>The behaviors are driven through {@link Behavior#apply} on the class the backend emitted, with
 * the instance and the input built once outside the timing, so nothing here measures reflection or
 * decoding. Each number is per element, because that is the figure that says whether the shape of
 * the generated code is right — a per-call figure only says how big the input was.
 *
 * <p>Two of them are the same traversal over the same list and differ in what they leave behind:
 * {@code sumAll} accumulates a number, {@code evensDoubled} accumulates lists. The distance between
 * them is what building a list costs, which is the cost the standard library's {@code map} and
 * {@code filter} pay per element.
