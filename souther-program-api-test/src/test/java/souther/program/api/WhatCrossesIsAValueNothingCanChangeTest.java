/**
 * Nothing an output is handed can be changed by whoever holds it.
 *
 * <p>A snapshot is what a compile decided, and a value of it that could be reached into is one whose
 * meaning moves after it was taken: a row's expectation edited through the collection it was built
 * with makes the same program answer differently about the same row. So every part of it that a
 * caller could still be holding is copied as it is taken.
 *
 * <p><b>Asked of the vocabulary rather than of the parts that were noticed.</b> Written out as a
 * list of types to check, this would be a copy of the constructors with the same hole in it — and
 * the hole would be in whichever one was written next. The types are reached from what an output
 * holds, and every one of them that keeps a collection is asked; a part in a shape this has no
 * sample of stops the walk rather than being passed over, so a type added later is one somebody has
 * to answer for.
