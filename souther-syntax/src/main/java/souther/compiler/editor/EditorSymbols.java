/**
 * How an editor classifies each symbol the language writes.
 *
 * <p>Every consumer that colours Souther reads this: the TextMate grammar, which matches text, and
 * the language server's semantic tokens, which classify by kind. Each used to carry its own list,
 * written by hand in its own terms, and the two had drifted three symbols apart.
 *
 * <p>Saying which symbols are <em>not</em> painted is as much of the classification as saying which
 * are. A consumer that only knew the operators could not tell a symbol left alone on purpose from
 * one nobody had got to yet, and would go on compiling once a symbol was added to the language.
 * Here the two are the same answer, and every symbol {@link SyntaxKind} spells has to be given one.
