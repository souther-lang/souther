/**
 * Where code this compile has no file for came from, and the name a reader here reaches it by.
 *
 * <p>Two facts about one body of code that are not the same fact, and neither is read off the
 * other. {@code module} is where the code lives — the module somebody published, the library module
 * the compiler ships. {@link #reachedBy()} is what a report writes: {@code Int.abs},
 * {@code lib.text.atLeast}, and {@code lib.text} itself where what is out of sight is a whole
 * module rather than something in one.
 *
 * <p>They are two components because a refinement of one must not destroy the other. A parse of a
 * published module knows the module and not which of its declarations a caller will land on, so the
 * name is replaced later, when a splice learns it ({@link #reachedBy(String)}). Held as one string
 * that replacement overwrites the module: {@code pricing} becomes {@code pricing.atLeast}, and the
 * day a published module carries where its source is, finding it again would mean splitting a
 * spelling — which is provenance inferred from how a name is written, the thing this exists to
 * stop. An alias, a re-export or a naming rule added later breaks that split without breaking
 * anything that would notice.
 *
 * <p>Which arm it is says what kind of thing this compile is without: a module somebody published,
 * or the library the compiler ships. Nothing reads the arm yet. It is here because the two have
 * different futures — a published module may one day be linked to and the library never will.
 *
 * <p>What this does <em>not</em> say is which source a line and a column are read in. That is a
 * separate question with a separate answer ({@link SourcePos#sourceId()}), and reading one off the
 * other is what this exists to stop: a body copied from out of sight is read against the caller's
 * file, so it is out of sight and in a source of this compile at once.
