/**
 * Where a position is: which text it is in, and whose code it carries.
 *
 * <p>Two questions, and this is their product. They look like one question and are not, which is
 * what the first attempt at this got wrong. A text put back together out of what a module published
 * has real positions — its line 4 is where that module's author wrote that code — and no reader
 * holds a file those numbers are of. Being unable to show a text and carrying somebody else's code
 * are different facts, and a value answering both with one boolean has to pick, so a splice into a
 * text nobody named had nowhere to land and rewrote which text it was in.
 *
 * <blockquote>
 * <table>
 *   <caption>What each question answers</caption>
 *   <tr><td><b>which text</b></td>
 *       <td>a source this compilation holds | a text it cannot name | what a module published</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td><b>whose code</b></td>
 *       <td>this position's own | copied here from somewhere else</td></tr>
 * </table>
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * <p>Six states, all of them reached, each explained in a sentence:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>a file this compile holds, code written at that position — every ordinary position.
 *   <li>a file this compile holds, code copied in from elsewhere — a spliced body, a report moved to
 *       an import line.
 *   <li>a text with no name here, code written at that position — a buffer an editor is holding, a
 *       snippet somebody parsed, and the position a pass mints to mean nowhere.
 *   <li>a text with no name here, code copied in — a body spliced into such a text: the caller can
 *       still point at the position and nobody else can.
 *   <li>a module's published text, code written at that position — where that module's author wrote
 *       it, in a text this compile has no file for.
 *   <li>a module's published text, code copied in from a third module — a body spliced in while the
 *       module was being read back.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Held as a pair because every pair is legal. Which is the same rule that put the two halves of a
 * position together in the first place: hold the pair where the pair is what is legal, and split it
 * where it is not. The nine combinations of a nullable source and a boolean were not all legal;
 * these six are.
 *
 * <p>A splice keeps the text and replaces the code. That is the whole of what it does, and it is why
 * {@link #standingInFor} cannot change which text a position is in.
 *
 * <p>Where the code is written follows from both: code copied here is written where it was copied
 * from, and code of its own is written wherever this text is — which is a module, for a published
 * one, and is nothing to state for a text a reader has in front of them.
 *
 * <p>Two rules hold over this and over everything that carries one.
 *
 * <blockquote>
 * A source location has exactly one authority for its provenance.
 * <br>
 * The source in which coordinates are interpreted is never inferred from how the code came to
 * exist.
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * <p>The first is why a placement is minted where a text is turned into positions and nowhere else:
 * a pass that worked provenance out downstream would be a second authority, and the two disagree the
 * day one of them learns something the other does not.
 *
 * <p>The second is what the two questions are. A shortcut in either direction — a text with no name
 * taken to mean the code is elsewhere, a copied body taken to be in the file it came from — puts
 * them back under one answer.
 *
 * <h2>What this publishes</h2>
 *
 * <p>Outside this package: three ways to make one, a way to make a position out of one, and nothing
 * else. It answers no question. Every question a reader has about a place is answered by exactly one
 * projection, and each lives here — {@link Citation#of} for what a report may say,
 * {@link DiagnosticPlace#of} for where a reader may be sent, {@link SourcePos#quotedFrom()} for
 * which file this is read from, {@link SourcePos#wasCopiedHere()} for whether the position is this
 * node's own.
 *
 * <p>A pass reading the components would be a further answer to whichever of those it was really
 * asking, arrived at privately, and that is the defect this family is. So both questions are
 * package-private: something publishing "is this named" would be the nullable source identity again
 * under a name that reads like an improvement.
 *
 * <p>Value equality, because {@link SourcePos} is compared by every pass that rebuilds a node, by the
 * incremental engine deciding whether an answer changed, and by the store deciding whether two
 * diagnostics are one problem.
 *
 * <p>Provenance is in the equality and is not published. A caller may ask whether this is the
 * placement it already holds and may not ask what it is: reading the declaration off a position and
 * writing a place of one's own is how one position came to be presented as where code is written by
 * three surfaces and qualified by one.
