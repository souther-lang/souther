/**
 * Which source of this compilation a position is read from, as a finished answer.
 *
 * <p>What a caller asks when it has to name a file: to file a report under one, to look up which
 * module a place is in, to open a document in an editor. The answer is a source this compilation
 * holds, or it is not — and where it is not, this says which of the two reasons, because they are
 * not the same reason and a caller does different things with them.
 *
 * <p>This is the question that used to be asked of a source identity that could be null. Reading the
 * absence was how five consumers came to answer a question nobody had given them: whether a reader
 * could be sent here. One took it to mean "file this under the module's source", one to mean "there
 * is no module", one to mean "open the module's document", one to mean "this report has not been
 * anchored yet", and one to mean "read it in the diagnostic's own file". Those are five answers to
 * three different questions, arrived at privately, out of a value that answered none of them.
 *
 * <p>So the classification is here and is made once, and what to do with each answer stays with the
 * caller. Those are different things: which answer a position has is a fact about the position, and
 * what a build does when there is no file to name is a policy of whatever is asking. A caller that
 * files a report under the source it was computing for and a caller that gives up are both right,
 * and neither of them is classifying.
 *
 * <p>Not an {@code Optional<SourceId>}. The two negative arms carry what a caller can say instead of
 * naming a file, and an optional would put "the code is in a module you do not have" and "this text
 * has no name yet" under one empty — which is the drop {@link DiagnosticPlace.Unavailable} exists to
 * stop, one layer up.
