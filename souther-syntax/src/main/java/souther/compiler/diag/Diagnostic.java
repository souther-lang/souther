/**
 * A compile diagnostic as data, not a pre-formatted string. A renderer turns it into human text
 * (Elm-style, with a source snippet) or JSON (for tools and agents).
 *
 * <p>What it says is a {@link Message}: a record whose components are the values it is about, which
 * names the catalog entry it renders through and the rule it reports. A site chooses neither of
 * those as a string, so a diagnostic cannot name an entry that says nothing about the values it
 * carries. The one thing built without a message is {@link #literal}, which is not a diagnostic a
 * check raises: it wraps text the compiler was handed.
 *
 * <p>The {@code code} (e.g. {@code E1301}) and the {@link TypeComparison} types are
 * locale-independent — the stable identity a tool keys on. Everything else (title, message, hints,
 * secondary labels) follows the locale.
