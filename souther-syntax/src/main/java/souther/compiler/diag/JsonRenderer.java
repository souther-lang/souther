/**
 * Renders a diagnostic as a single JSON object for tools and agents. {@code code} and the type
 * strings are locale-independent (the stable identity); {@code message}, {@code hints}, and
 * secondary {@code label}s follow the selected locale.
 *
 * <p>A secondary in another file carries that file's {@code file}, which means what the top-level
 * one does — the name a reader opens. The compiler's own id for a source is not written: it is a
 * position in the list the caller handed over on the command line and a document URI in an editor,
 * so it names nothing a tool could hold on to.
