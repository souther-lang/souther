/**
 * What would answer a finding: the text to write, and — where the finding knows it — the characters
 * to write it over.
 *
 * <p>Two shapes because a check can know the word without there being anywhere here to put it. A
 * name inside a body an expansion copied in sits at a line of the author's file and says nothing
 * about what is written there, and a name nobody wrote has no place at all; the reader is still
 * better told what was probably meant. So the word travels either way and the edit does not, and a
 * caller that needs to write something has to say which of the two it is looking at.
 *
 * <p>{@link AnEdit#target()} is the answer to a different question from a diagnostic's
 * {@link Primary}. What a finding is said about and what makes it go away are the same stretch often
 * enough to be mistaken for one rule, and they are not: a qualified name nothing denotes is reported
 * over the whole name and repaired by rewriting the one part that is wrong, and a report moved to
 * where a reader can reach it ({@link Diagnostic#reachedFrom}) is said at an import while the text
 * to change stays where it was written.
 *
 * <p>And both are a third question again from where an offer to apply it stands, which is where the
 * problem is marked. Nothing here answers that: a repair is what an author gets for saying yes, not
 * what puts the question in front of them.
