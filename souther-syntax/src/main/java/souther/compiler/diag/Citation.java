/**
 * Where the code something is about is written, as a report is entitled to say it.
 *
 * <p>A position is put to two uses and only one of them can be wrong. Sending a reader somewhere —
 * a caret, a range, an editor jumping — is right whatever the position stands for, because it is
 * where this compile met the code and the only place a reader can be sent. Saying the code is
 * <em>written</em> there is right only where it is. Nothing distinguished the two, so every surface
 * that wanted the first published the second: an unreached arm of {@code List.filter} was reported
 * at the caller's {@code 15:23} by the adequacy report in both of its renderings and by the JSON a
 * diagnostic is read from, and one renderer out of four said what the position stood for.
 *
 * <p>So the two are separate values. {@link SourcePos} is where this compile placed a node, and every
 * pass reads it freely. This is the other one, and it is what a report holds: a coverage site, a
 * finding, a reason carries this rather than a position, so a surface written later is handed the
 * answer rather than the raw place.
 *
 * <h2>The four arms</h2>
 *
 * <p>The same two questions a {@link Placement} answers, said in what a report may write. Whether
 * this compilation can show a reader the text the position is in, and whether the code the position
 * names is written at it:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link Written} — the file is one the reader holds, and the code is at the position.
 *   <li>{@link Unplaced} — the code is at the position, and this compilation cannot name the text
 *       it is in. An editor's unsaved buffer is one, and so is a snippet somebody parsed.
 *   <li>{@link Reached} — the file is one the reader holds, and what is written there is a call the
 *       code was reached through. {@link Elsewhere#provenance()} says where the code is.
 *   <li>{@link OutOfSight} — the code is elsewhere and there is no text to point at: the position is
 *       inside the code, in a text put back together out of what a module published.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>{@link Reached} and {@link OutOfSight} used to be one arm, whose accessor said its position was
 * "a place in a file the reader holds" and was handed the second case's position — a line of a text
 * nobody has. Every surface that read it was right about the reports that had been anchored to an
 * import line and wrong about any that had not, and nothing told the two apart.
 *
 * <p>No accessor spans a case that has a position and one that does not. A reader that wants the
 * position — to put a caret at it — says which case it is in first, and having said so has seen that
 * the others exist. An {@code at()} on this interface would be the shortest way back to the defect:
 * every caller would write it, the sum would decorate nothing, and the cases with nothing to point
 * at would go unread again.
 *
 * <p>{@link Elsewhere} spans the two arms that say the code is elsewhere, and carries only what they
 * agree about: where that code is. Which is the safe half. A renderer qualifying a sentence with
 * "the code is written in {@code List.filter}" says the same thing whether or not there was somewhere
 * to point, and would otherwise ask the question twice.
 *
 * <p>Built one way. {@link #of} asks the position's {@link Placement} to project itself, which is the
 * only thing a placement will do for a caller and is package-private so that it stays so, and the arms
 * cannot be built or implemented from outside this package. So there is no independent construction
 * path: every citation is a projection of what a position already carries.
 *
 * <p>Which is a rule about where a statement comes from and not a claim that provenance is a secret.
 * A caller may stamp a position itself and project that, and may compare a provenance against one it
 * builds. What it may not do is read the declaration off a position and write a place of its own,
 * which is the defect this exists to close.
