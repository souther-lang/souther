 * A compile error with a source position. Carries an error code (e.g. {@code E1101})
 * when one applies (spec §compile-errors), otherwise a bare message for lex/parse errors.
 *
 * <p>The exception now wraps a structured {@link Diagnostic}. {@link #getMessage()} still returns the
 * one-line {@code line:col code: message} form (so existing callers and tests are unchanged), while a
 * renderer can take {@link #diagnostic()} and produce the Elm-style snippet or JSON. A site that has
 * not been moved onto a catalog key throws with a literal message, wrapped as a
 * {@link Diagnostic#literal literal} diagnostic.
 *
 * <p>Most phases stop at the first error, so the exception carries one diagnostic. A phase that finds
 * several independent errors at once — every failing {@code example} row — throws them all through
 * {@link #diagnostics()}, and the CLI and the annotation processor print each. {@link #diagnostic()}
 * is then the first: the one a single-diagnostic caller reads.
