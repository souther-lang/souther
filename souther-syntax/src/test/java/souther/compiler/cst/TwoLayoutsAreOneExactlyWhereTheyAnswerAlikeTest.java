/**
 * Two layouts are one value exactly where they answer alike.
 *
 * <p>A layout is asked one thing: where a place sits in the text as it now stands. So two of them
 * being one value has to mean that they answer that the same way for every place either can be
 * asked — because what holds one compares it against the one an edit replaced it with, and keeps
 * what it had wherever the two are equal. An equality that is coarser than the answer is a reader
 * kept on numbers the new text does not have.
 *
 * <p>Which is why the constructs are part of it. A place names a token <em>of a construct</em>, so
 * the same tokens falling into constructs differently is a different set of answers. Compared by
 * where the tokens sit with the constructs run together, the two texts below came out equal while
 * disagreeing about where five of the places they can both be asked about are.
