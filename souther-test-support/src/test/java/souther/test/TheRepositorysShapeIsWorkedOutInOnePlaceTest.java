/**
 * That nobody works out the repository's shape a second time.
 *
 * <p>Before {@link RepositoryLayout} there were eleven answers to where the repository root is and
 * eight to which modules it has. None of them was wrong when it was written. What they cost was
 * that each was one more place to be one module behind, and a check whose scan is one module behind
 * reports a pass about the modules it read and says nothing about the rest — which is the shape
 * those checks exist to refuse.
 *
 * <p>Moving them here fixes the eleven that existed. This is what stops the twelfth: a tripwire on
 * the ways the answer has actually been worked out before, and not an analysis of every way it
 * could be. It names what it caught, so the reply to it is to ask {@link RepositoryLayout} rather
 * than to spell the same derivation differently.
 *
 * <p>Deliberately not covered: a path that names one directory of another module, as four checks
 * spell the default library. That is a source this repository holds and not the shape of the
 * repository, so no answer here would be the one they want.
