/**
 * What a fork pays to read a compiled output.
 *
 * <p>The classes a check reads were written by the compile the run is testing and do not change
 * while it runs, so what each question costs is decided by how much of the output it needs and not
 * by how many questions there are. That is a fact about the reading rather than about the clock, so
 * it is asked of a reading that says what it touched: a timing would answer about the machine, and
 * would go on passing while every question read the module again.
 *
 * <p>The counted reading stands in for the one a fork shares. That the fork's own reading is made
 * in one place is a different question, and {@link OnePlaceMakesTheReadingAForkSharesTest} asks it.
