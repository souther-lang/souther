/**
 * One compiled output, as the checks of this repository read it.
 *
 * <p>What a rule about compiled code is asked of. The classes under one output root are fixed for
 * the length of a run — they were written by the compile the run is testing — and this is where a
 * check reaches them, so that the reading is done once for the fork rather than once for the
 * question. What each check does with them differs, so what is answered here is the classes and
 * never a verdict about them.
 *
 * <p><b>Four ways of asking, and each pays for what it asks.</b> A rule about a whole module walks
 * {@link #all}; a rule about one class asks {@link #find}, which reaches that file and no other; a
 * rule about a package asks {@link #inPackage}, which settles which files are in it before any of
 * them is parsed; a rule that wants only what there is asks {@link #names}, which reads none of
 * them. A rule that could only have the whole module would make the narrow questions pay for the
 * wide one, and the narrowest of them reads eight classes of four thousand.
 *
 * <p><b>Which output is asked is the caller's to name, and so is what to do with two of them.</b> A
 * rule about what this repository publishes and a rule about what a test compiled beside it are
 * about two populations, and a reader that searched several outputs in some order would be deciding
 * for its callers which population they meant. One of these is one output root.
 *
 * <p>An output root is settled with {@link Path#toRealPath} before it becomes the name of anything,
 * so that a module found through the class path and the same module found by walking the repository
 * are one output and not two. What is found on the class path as a jar is not an output root: there
 * is nothing to walk and nothing to settle, and a check about a module built beside this one asks
 * about the module rather than about the artifact it was packaged into.
