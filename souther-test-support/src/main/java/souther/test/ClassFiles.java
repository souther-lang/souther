/**
 * Where a reading of a compiled output touches the file system.
 *
 * <p>Both ways of touching it are here, because a reading that asked this for the bytes and looked
 * for the file itself would leave half of what it does outside the boundary — and a rule saying
 * where compiled output is reached could then be met while the file system was still being asked
 * somewhere else.
 *
 * <p>An interface because what a reading costs is a question about it: a caller counting what was
 * touched hands one that counts and asks the reading, rather than the reading keeping a tally of
 * its own. A tally kept inside would be a number nothing spends, and it would be there in every run
 * to serve a question only a check asks.
