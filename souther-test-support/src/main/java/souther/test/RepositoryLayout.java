/**
 * The shape of this repository, read once.
 *
 * <p>A check that asks about the repository rather than about one class needs the same few answers:
 * where the root is, which modules the reactor owns, and where each of them keeps its sources.
 * Answered separately in each check, the answers drift, and the one that stops covering the module
 * added next says nothing about it while still reporting a pass.
 *
 * <p>The modules come from the root pom, which is what the reactor itself reads. A list written
 * here would be a copy of the reactor rather than a reading of it.
 *
 * <p>Everything below is stated positively: a source tree is {@code <module>/src}, and that is the
 * whole of what a walk descends into. Nothing is subtracted. This matters beyond tidiness, because
 * subtraction has to name every kind of file a build writes and is always one name short —
 * {@code target/} was the first and surefire's {@code .surefire-*} record, written beside the
 * module while the tests run, was the second. Both are siblings of {@code src} rather than children
 * of it, so a walk given a source tree cannot reach either, and a walk that cannot reach them
 * cannot race with the build writing them.
 *
 * <p>It follows that what such a walk costs is set by how much source there is, and not by how
 * large {@code .git} has grown or how much a build has written. That is the property to hold on to:
 * a check that reads sources should not get slower because the repository has more of something
 * else in it.
 *
 * <p>A module the root pom names whose directory or pom is missing is refused rather than skipped:
 * the reactor could not build such a repository, and a check that quietly walked one module fewer
 * would answer about the modules it read and say nothing about the rest. A module with no
 * {@code src} is not that — a module can legitimately have no sources of its own — so it
 * contributes no source tree and no complaint.
