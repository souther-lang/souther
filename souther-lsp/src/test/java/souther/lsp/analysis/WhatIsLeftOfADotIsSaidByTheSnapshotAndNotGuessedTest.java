/**
 * The parser reads {@code m.name} and {@code x.field} the same way, so what may be written after a
 * {@code .} is not a question the syntax answers. It is answered on the source as it stands
 * mid-edit, and the answer says which of the two the author is looking at.
 *
 * <p>The two are asked together because they pull the probe's rule in opposite directions. What may
 * be read off a repaired source is what was written before anything was put in, and the access
 * around the cursor never is: it runs to the end of the name the probe supplied. The receiver does —
 * a value's occurrence stops at the {@code .}, and so does a qualifier. So the rule is put to where
 * the receiver is written, which is what {@link MemberReceiver#writtenAt} carries.
