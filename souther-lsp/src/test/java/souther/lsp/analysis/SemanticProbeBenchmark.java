/**
 * What it costs to answer about a line the author has not finished — the measurement the decision to
 * keep a second store rests on.
 *
 * <p>To re-measure, take the {@code @Disabled} off and run
 * {@code mvn -o test -Dtest=SemanticProbeBenchmark -Dsurefire.failIfNoSpecifiedTests=false}. Nothing
 * on the command line turns a disabled test back on, and the run's JVM flags are the reactor's —
 * {@code -XX:TieredStopAtLevel=1 -XX:+UseSerialGC}, which is what every test here runs under. So
 * these are C1-only, serial-collector numbers: what they are good for is the increment between two
 * of them, and not for saying whether a millisecond figure fits an editor's budget.
 *
 * <p><b>What is measured, and against what.</b> Four numbers, all taken in one run on one workspace,
 * because a millisecond on its own says nothing and an increment between two says something. The
 * floor is what a keystroke already costs: the workspace's store catching up and the question being
 * put again. Beside it is the same keystroke on a line that stops at a {@code .}, which the workspace
 * cannot hold at all — that one goes through the probe's own store. Then the same with nothing kept
 * between rounds, which is what a store built per keystroke rather than kept would cost every time.
 * Then what the second store keeps alive, measured with it present and absent.
 *
 * <p><b>Why the workspace here is generated.</b> The figure in {@code Analyzer.compileOf} — 7.3 of
 * 9.3 milliseconds, on a crm workspace of seven sources and 3898 lines — was taken against sources
 * this repository does not hold in that shape, so it is a rough reference and not a baseline these
 * numbers continue. The corpus that is held, in {@code souther-bench}, cannot be reached from here:
 * {@code souther-bench} depends on {@code souther-lsp}, so the edge cannot run the other way. What is
 * generated instead states its own size, and every number below is compared with another taken in
 * the same run on the same sources.
 *
 * <p>Observed, three runs on 7 modules and 3261 lines, medians:
 * <pre>
 *   steady:    workspace  9.8 ms    probe 11.3 ms
 *   cold:      workspace 18.8 ms    probe 20.9 ms
 *   by turns:  workspace  9.1 ms    probe 11.2 ms
 *   retained:  workspace 14.3 MB    workspace and probe 17.2 MB
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>A probe costs about a millisecond and a half a keystroke, and about three megabytes on a
 * workspace of this size. What each of the other two rows is there to refuse did not happen. The
 * workspace's own keystroke costs no more with a probe running beside it than without — 9.1 against
 * 9.8, which is the same number — so the probe takes nothing from the store it is beside; the two
 * stores are separate, and this is what says the separation holds in practice as well as on paper.
 * And the probe's store keeps what it answered: 11.3 against 20.9 from cold is the same 54% the
 * workspace's own store shows, 9.8 against 18.8. The ratio is the compiler's memoisation and not the
 * probe's, and the point is that the probe gets all of it.
