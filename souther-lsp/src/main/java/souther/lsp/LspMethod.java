/**
 * Every request and notification this server answers, and what tells a client about each.
 *
 * <p>The set lives here rather than in the case labels of a switch because the rest of the server
 * has to read it. What the handshake advertises and what is registered after it are both built from
 * these values, so the two cannot say something the server does not answer; and a method cannot be
 * answered without being one of these values, because {@link LspServer} reaches its handlers only
 * through {@link #of}. A method nobody was told about is then not something to test for — it is
 * something there is no way to write.
 *
 * <p>What a method is advertised by is not a name derived from the method's own: three notifications
 * share one capability, one method is registered after the handshake instead, and the lifecycle is
 * announced by nothing. Each of those is a value here rather than a row missing from a table.
