/**
 * The document being typed in, made whole enough to be resolved, without any of it being answered
 * from an earlier one.
 *
 * <p>What an editor asks about a position is asked while the position is mid-edit. {@code
 * request.plannedCost.} is where a field list is wanted and is not a document that parses — the
 * parser reads {@code .} as a field access only with a name after it — and a document that does not
 * parse is held out of the compile, so the compiler has nothing to say about it exactly where it is
 * being asked. That is not a gap in what the compiler knows. It is the current source not reaching
 * the compiler at all.
 *
 * <p>So the current source is made to reach it. Not the last one that did: a receiver edited from
 * {@code customer.address.} to {@code customer.amount.} would be answered with the fields of
 * {@code Address}, which is a wrong answer wearing the shape of a right one, and worse than no
 * answer. What is compiled here is always what the buffer says now.
 *
 * <p><b>Insertion only, at or after the cursor.</b> Nothing is deleted and nothing replaced, so
 * every offset before the first inserted character is the offset it was, and an extent that ends
 * there covers the characters it covered. What may be read off a probe is exactly that far: an
 * extent ending at or before the insertion. Not "an extent that does not overlap the insertion" —
 * a name put in front of the next line changes how the next line reads without touching it, and
 * overlap does not tell the two apart.
 *
 * <p>Which is enough for what asks. A field list wants the type of what is left of the {@code .},
 * and that ends before it. A signature help wants the callee and which argument is being written:
 * the callee's name ends before the {@code (}, and the argument's number is counted in the source as
 * the author left it — the call's own extent, which would take in a bracket that was put there, is
 * not read.
 *
 * <p>Its own compile, kept beside the workspace's rather than written into it. Two reasons, and each
 * on its own is enough. The workspace's compile publishes diagnostics, and a marker made by a
 * bracket nobody typed is a marker about nothing. And it is incremental: answers stand until
 * something they read changes, so a store fed the real text and the repaired one by turns re-answers
 * the edited module every time it is asked — which is the module every one of these questions is
 * about.
