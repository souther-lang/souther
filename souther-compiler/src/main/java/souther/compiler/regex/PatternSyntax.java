 * A pattern of the subset this compiler reads, as what it says rather than as how it is written.
 *
 * <p>What is kept is what the language depends on and nothing else. A reading that dropped an arm of
 * a choice, an upper bound of a repetition, or the far end of a class would be a tree that answers
 * for a narrower language than the pattern names — and the answer would be wrong in the direction
 * nothing catches, since a narrower set still accepts the values somebody wrote.
 *
 * <p><b>No node for a literal.</b> One written character is one symbol, which is a set of one, and a
 * second shape for it would be two spellings of a thing that is compared. {@link Symbols} is where a
 * literal, a class, a negated class, a shorthand and {@code .} all arrive, told apart only by which
 * symbols they hold — which is the whole of what they say.
 *
 * <p>How a match is walked leaves no trace. Whether a repetition is greedy, whether a group
 * captures, and whether a marker is reluctant say what an engine does on the way rather than which
 * strings come out, so none of them is here.
 *
 * <p>An anchor is not one of those, and is kept ({@link Anchor}). Where it is written decides which
 * strings are accepted: {@code ^ab} accepts what {@code ab} accepts, and {@code a^b} accepts
 * nothing at all, since no position is both after an {@code a} and at the start. Read as adding
 * nothing wherever it appeared, the second was accepted as the first — a pattern this compiler
 * said it had read exactly, and had read as another one.
