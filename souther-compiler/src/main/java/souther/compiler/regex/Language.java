 * A set of strings this compiler can answer about exactly.

 * <p><b>Asking is free and composing is not.</b> Everything a caller may ask one of these — whether
 * it holds a string, whether it holds nothing, whether it holds everything, whether it is the same
 * set as another — is read off the machine in front of it. What is not free is making a new
 * language out of two: a meet is the product of two machines and may be larger than this compiler
 * will build, so every way to a language takes what it is allowed and answers null past it.
 *
 * <p>Which is the one thing a caller has to hold: a language is a set and may be asked anything,
 * and putting two of them together is an operation that can decline. Written the other way round —
 * composition total, questions doing the work — the work would happen inside whichever question was
 * asked first, where there is no allowance and nobody counting.
 *
 * <p><b>And it is why one is not made from a pattern.</b> Whether the work of answering exactly is
 * worth doing is a question about the answer being built, not about any one pattern in it: a
 * pattern read on its own and admitted on its own is one that may still be met with another, and
 * the meet is where the cost is. So a language is compiled from the whole of what a question needs
 * at once ({@link PatternPlan}), and what a reading spends putting them together is held beside the
 * reading ({@code souther.compiler.values.Sets}).
 *
 * <p>Nothing here is about how a language was written. Two patterns that accept the same strings are
 * the same language, and a reader asking what one holds is answered by the strings.
