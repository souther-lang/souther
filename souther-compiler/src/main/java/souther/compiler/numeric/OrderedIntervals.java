/**
 * What the ordered rules leave each position, over all the rules a reading took in.
 *
 * <p>A state and not an interval. A rule is written about a whole value and may name several of its
 * positions, and the connectives join whole readings rather than the range at one position — so what
 * a conjunction and a disjunction are applied to is this, and the arithmetic at one position is
 * {@link OrderedInterval}.
 *
 * <p><b>Bottom is a state and not always a position.</b> The rules leave nothing where some position
 * is left no value — and also where every alternative of a choice is one nobody can take, which is
 * not a fact about any one position. The second is {@code nothing}, and it is why the two cannot be
 * one answer: a choice between {@code a < ""} and {@code b < ""} admits nothing, and neither
 * {@code a} nor {@code b} is a position the choice leaves empty, since each alternative admits every
 * value of the other's.
 *
 * <p><b>A position not held here is every value its order has.</b> Which is what makes a meet with
 * what the rules said the whole answer, and what makes a join drop a position only one side bounded:
 * joining with everything is everything.
 *
 * <p><b>One direction only.</b> This exists to decide that a position holds no value, so every
 * operation that cannot be exact widens. A choice between two ranges is the ends around both, which
 * admits values neither alternative does; a state that narrowed there would refuse a model somebody
 * can write.
 *
 * <p>Apart from {@link NumericDomain}, which relates positions to each other by differences and can
 * only do so over numbers a model adds. This relates no two positions and holds every order there
 * is — so a rule comparing a date against a written one lands here, and one comparing two fields of
 * a record lands there. Both may hold the same rule about an {@code Int}, and neither is the other's
 * copy: what each of them can show is its own, and a contradiction shown anywhere is a contradiction.
 *
 * <p><b>The states are the ones these operations reach.</b> The two parts depend on each other —
 * {@code nothing} says the whole is empty where no position is, and a position left an empty range
 * says it where the whole need not carry it — so a pair of them written down side by side is a
 * combination nothing read. What the parts are is this one's own; a caller reaches a state by doing
 * to a reading what the state says was done to it.
