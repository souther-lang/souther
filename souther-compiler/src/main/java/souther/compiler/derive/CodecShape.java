/**
 * What a field carries across the boundary, as the shape a codec is built out of.
 *
 * <p>Reading a type and admitting it are one walk, for the reason {@code SignatureBoundary} gives on
 * the behavior's side: asked separately, what the checker admits and what the builders can construct
 * agree only by coincidence, and a builder missing an arm then reports the type it did not implement
 * as a type the language refuses. A shape exists because {@link #of} built it, and both the decoder
 * and the encoder are lowered from that one shape rather than each deciding again.
 *
 * <p>The split between this and {@link Bare} is the one rule the tree itself holds: an optional's
 * value is a {@code Bare}, so an optional under an optional cannot be constructed. Absence has one
 * form wherever it stands (spec {@code [#absence-is-written-as-null]}), so {@code None},
 * {@code Some(None)} and {@code Some(Some(v))} are three values facing two forms; leaving the
 * recursion open would give this tree an admitted set wider than the boundary has representations
 * for, which is the disagreement the type is here to make unwritable.
