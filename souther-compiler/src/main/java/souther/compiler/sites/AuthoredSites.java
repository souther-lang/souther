 * point with is a position. The two are joined here and nowhere else: the walk that mints a {@link
 * SourceSiteId} is the walk that checks the rule the id rests on, so a reader that holds one holds
 * an occurrence that was found to be the only one written over those characters.
 *
 * <p>Taken from the resolved module and not from anything below it. A pass carries an extent across
 * on purpose and helper expansion stamps a call site's extent over a copied body, so after one has
 * run an extent no longer says which occurrence it is (ADR-0102). Here nothing has run: what a name
 * means is settled, which is what tells {@code x.field} from {@code Module.name}, and no body has
 * been copied into another.
 *
 * <p>Expressions only. A type name is written in its own positions and answered about by its own
 * question ({@code Names.DenotedAt}), and nothing here would add to that.
 *
 * <p>An answer of the query graph, so it is a value and two of them are equal when they hold the
 * same sites — an edit that puts the source back where it was costs nothing downstream.
