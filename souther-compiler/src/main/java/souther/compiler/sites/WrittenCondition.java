 * One condition a source wrote, as the module that wrote it files it.
 *
 * <p>An address and not a place. What is here is which condition of which source, said so that a
 * copy cannot change it: a helper expanded into three callers puts one condition in three trees,
 * and where it is written is the writing module's answer rather than something each copy carries.
 *
 * <p><b>Two shapes, because two things are conditions and only one of them is a construct.</b> A
 * comparison and a short-circuit operator are constructs the source wrote and carry an origin of
 * their own. An arm of a fork is not: what the source wrote there is the fork, and the arm stands
 * among its arms by an index. So the arm borrows the fork's identity and does not borrow its place
 * — what is filed for one is where the arm itself is written, which is what a reader is shown.
 *
 * <p><b>Not every condition a reading meets.</b> A condition of a shape the reading has no words
 * for is any expression at all, and the source wrote no construct there this can name; where such
 * a one is reported is asked of the reading that met it
 * ({@link souther.compiler.partition.ConditionReportAnchor}). Widened to cover those, this would
 * be a question the writing module answers with a place it worked out for something else.
