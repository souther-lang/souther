     * module can see is an index, and reading one as a value makes an edit to any entry an edit to
     * all of them: every body of the module, and of every module importing it, is re-checked because
     * one clause elsewhere was written differently.
     *
     * <p>Recomputing this is not the same as its answer changing. It reads the module's table, so the
     * table is rebuilt whenever any clause in that file is edited, and this stops the rebuild from
     * reaching a reader wherever it comes out equal. What is left is the cost of rebuilding the
     * table, which is a question about this producer and not about who depends on it.
     *
     * <p>Answered without its places, which is the whole of what a caller assumes. A contract as the
     * declaration holds it carries where its terms were written and the ordinals the module numbered
     * them with, and on that value nothing below an edit ever comes out equal: a blank line moves
     * every position under it, and a clause gaining a term moves every ordinal under it. A caller
     * reads neither — it substitutes its own arguments into the terms and reads what they say.
     *
     * <p>Taken out here rather than ignored when comparing. An answer whose equality says one thing
     * and whose value says another is one a reader can tell apart after the store has decided they
     * are the same, and the store decides that on behalf of everything downstream. So the two are
     * one value: what this hands over is what it is compared by. The declaration's own reading, with
     * its places, is {@link StatedContracts}, which is what an editor and a diagnostic want.
     *
     * <p>Absent where the behavior states nothing, and where the module that declares it could not be

     * <p>Read off the body the discharge analysis is given, because that is the tree the contract
     * lookup runs over: what it finds is a call whose function is a name denoting a behavior, so what
     * it can find is what is written there. That tree has its helper calls expanded, which widens
     * nothing on its own — a helper cannot call a behavior (E1818). What reading it buys is that the
     * frontier is taken from the tree the lookup walks rather than from one that agrees with it.
     *
     * <p>Every behavior a name reaches, and not the ones that may be called by name. A behavior
     * arrives at a body by being built and called or by being injected, and which of the two decides
     * how the call is typed rather than whose contract is read — {@link CalleeSigs} and
     * {@link ReqSigs} split them for the first question, and this is the second.
     *
     * <p>An injected one is reached through the parameter {@code depends on} gave the body, so the
     * name written at the call denotes that parameter and not the behavior. Which parameter stands
     * for which behavior is {@link SpecChecker#dependencyBindings}, asked rather than worked out
     * again: the clause and the parameter list are read together in order and not paired by name,
     * because two modules may declare a behavior of one name, and the answer is a binding because a
     * binding in force wins over the declaration it shadows (spec §fn-rules). Neither is a
     * difference a program can show here — a {@code depends on} its body never calls is refused
     * (E1603), so a shadow of that spelling has the parameter beside it — which is why it is asked
     * of the one place that decides it rather than settled again by whatever agrees today.
     *
     * <p>Every name, and not every application. A behavior named where a value goes becomes the
     * function it names, and what applies it may be a binding away, so a walk that only read
     * applications would miss one the body really does call. Measured: reached through a binding
     * that is then applied, and not reached at all where nothing reads the binding — a binding
     * nothing reads is not in the tree this walks. So the frontier is drawn wider than the
     * applications and comes out the same size, and a name that could be left in it costs a
     * dependency this body has not got rather than losing one it has.
     *
     * <p>Absent where the body or the declaration is not there to read, which is not the same
     * answer as reaching nothing: the check that reads contracts is skipped where the body is,
     * and a body that reaches no behavior is checked with none. Saying "nothing" for both would

     * bodies of what they name expanded in turn until nothing new is named.
     *
     * <p>The seeds are the trees, and there are two kinds. A definition's body is expanded by {@link
     * LoweredBody}, which answers with what it left standing. A clause — a data's {@code invariant},
     * a behavior's {@code ensures} — is not a definition and is in no table, so what it reaches is

     * {@code ensures}, so a rule reaching a fold asked for no fold.
     *
     * <p>The closure is the expansion's, not the call graph's. A body reaches a recursion by
     * applying it and by reading a value whose own body applies it, and only the first is a call —
     * so a graph of calls answers about a narrower relation than the one that decides this, and a
     * recursion behind a value is reached by the expansion and by nothing that could see it. Each
     * required recursion is therefore expanded in its turn: it is emitted as a method, so its body
     * is expanded on its own rather than into anything, and what that leaves standing is required
     * too.
     *
     * <p>Being required and having been read are two things. A recursion this module declared is
     * required before the walk begins, and its body still goes through it — a walk that took its
     * result set for its work list would never read one.
     *
     * <p>A helper this module declared is here whether or not anything reaches it: its source is
     * this module's to check and to publish, which is not a question about use. Only what it did not
