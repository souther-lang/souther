/**
 * What an evaluation of one module's examples reads, put together in one place.
 *
 * <p>Four readers wanted the same thing and each worked it out again: running a source's rows,
 * building the fakes it wrote, comparing what two written statements say, and handing the rows to a
 * caller that runs them one at a time. The same six questions asked of the same module, and the
 * same lines deciding whether the answers were there yet, written four times.
 *
 * <p>What that cost is not the repetition. It is that "this module can have its examples evaluated"
 * had four definitions and nothing said they were the same one — a reader added later got whichever
 * of them it was copied from, and a condition tightened in one place stayed loose in the other
 * three. Asked here, there is one.
 *
 * <p><b>Not a key, and it must not become one.</b> What this hands back is not a value: a
 * {@code Symbols} closes over the store it resolves against, so an answer holding one would be tied
 * to the session it was taken from and could never equal its own recomputation — which is the one
 * thing this store's answers may not do. It is why the symbols are reached through a helper rather
 * than a key of their own. Each of the six parts is memoised where it is answered; putting them
 * side by side is the cheap part and is done afresh.
 *
 * <p>Null where any part of it is missing, and it does not say which. What a caller does about a
 * module that cannot be read yet differs — one goes absent, one has nothing to report, one raises —
 * and each of those is the caller's answer to its own question rather than a shade of this one.
