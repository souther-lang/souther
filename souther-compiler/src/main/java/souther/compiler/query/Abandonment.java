import java.util.function.BooleanSupplier;

/**
 * What long work asks between its steps: whether whoever set it going still wants the answer.
 *
 * <p>One value rather than a boolean passed down, because the two ends of it are not alike. What
 * makes work stop is a question only its caller can answer — a client that cancelled a request, a
 * keystroke that arrived while a diagnose was walking — and every step in between should be able to
 * ask it without being told which of those it is. A step asks {@link #stopIfAsked} and goes on.
 *
 * <p>Asking is not a place to do anything else. A supplier that throws is throwing what the work
 * should stop for, and this passes it through: the caller that built this decides both what stopping
 * means and what stopping raises.
 *
 * <p>Where to ask is once per turn of a walk, and not once per operation that looks expensive. What
 * costs is enumerating, and a walk enumerating a thousand things that each cost nothing costs as
 * much as one enumerating a thousand that each cost something. A step that goes on to call something
 * which asks is covered; a step that may do nothing at all is not, and is where the asking has to be.
