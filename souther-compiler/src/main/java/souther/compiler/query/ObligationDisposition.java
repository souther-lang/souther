/**
 * What became of one obligation the model owes a row at.
 *
 * <p>Derived from the evidence and never held beside it. What the readings came to
 * ({@link ObligationCoverage}) and what has shown a row can be written here
 * ({@link ItemAssessment.WritabilityEvidence}) are answers to two questions, and this is the one
 * question a count, a finding and a build's refusal all put: is this row written, owed, or neither.
 * Asked of the evidence at each of those places instead, the three had three chances to read one
 * pair of answers differently.
 *
 * <p><b>Three states, and every one of them is counted.</b> Whether a row is owed at a point is the
 * model's answer and is settled before anything here: a border that owes no row at a point says so
 * with a reason read off the rules ({@link souther.compiler.partition.NotOwedReason}), and a point
 * the rules leave nothing at never becomes an obligation. Nothing this compiler failed to read,
 * compose or represent reaches that decision, so nothing here subtracts. What the three say is what
 * is known about a point that is owed: a row stands at it, no row does and something showed one
 * could, or nobody can say which.
 *
 * <p>There was a fourth. A point every row was read against and none was at, with nothing to show a
 * row could be written there, was left out of the account entirely — on the reading that asking for
 * a row nothing promises is asking for work nobody can do. That reads a limit of this compiler as an
 * answer about the model. Nothing composed and every candidate refused are facts about the composer;
 * the model's own refusal has its own way of being said, one paragraph up, and is not any of them.
 * What the fourth state cost is that a field nobody could compose a value for took its siblings'
 * obligations out of the denominator with it — the row is written against the whole value, so one
 * unreadable rule anywhere under a parameter emptied the grounds for every point beneath it
 * (issue #1249).
 *
 * <p><b>And an open question carries what it is open on.</b> A name for the question alone sends
 * every reader back to the evidence beside it to work out what to say, and each of them works it
 * out on its own terms — so what one point is open on is as many answers as there are readers
 * ({@link Uncertainty}). Which is also why the two questions are families rather than names: a
 * reading that stopped short and no reading at all are one question open for two reasons, and so
 * are a showing a budget ended and a showing nothing ever made.
