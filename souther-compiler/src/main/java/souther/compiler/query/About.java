/**
 * What one {@link Adequacy.Finding} is about.
 *
 * <p>The value a measure established, handed on as itself. Not the arguments of a sentence: a
 * finding used to carry {@code List<Object>} in the order a message key took them, so what each
 * element was followed from the kind and from nothing written down, and every reader indexed into it
 * and cast. Two defects came out of that in one change — a record's {@code toString} published as a
 * document's subject, and a cast that would have survived compiling with an element inserted ahead
 * of it — and nothing but a reader caught either.
 *
 * <p>Nothing here is a projection made for a reader. Where a measure already holds the item — a
 * point of a border, a question nothing answered, an arm — that value arrives whole, because a value
 * taken apart at a seam loses a part at every one it crosses and a value that is not taken apart
 * cannot lose one. Words about these belong to whoever writes a sentence: a report can name a file
 * and a diagnostic cannot, and the two are readings of one item rather than one of them being handed
 * the other's answer.
 *
 * <p>Which {@link Adequacy.Kind} a finding has is derived from this and is not held beside it, so a
 * kind and what it is about cannot disagree. This does not know its own kind: the classification and
 * the word a document publishes for it are downstream of what the finding is about, and a subject
 * that answered which public category it lands in would be the leak this type exists to close.
 *
 * <p>Every one of these holds what it names. A finding whose subject is absent is a finding about
 * nothing, and the reader that would find out is whichever surface first asks the subject a
 * question — a different one per surface, and none of them where the finding was made. The list
 * this replaced refused a null element as a side effect of being copied, and a shape that says so
 * itself keeps what the copy was doing by accident.
