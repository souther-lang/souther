/**
 * One condition of a decision rule, as a reader is told about it.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code DecisionRule} is for identity; this is for explanation.</b> A rule is told apart by
 * the distinctions it consulted, written the one way round that makes a comparison and its denial
 * one column — so {@code n > 100} in the source is held as the proposition {@code n <= 100} denied.
 * That is what an account has to key on and it is not what an author wrote. Rendered into a
 * sentence, it would show somebody a comparison they did not write, the wrong way round, and the
 * canonicalisation this compiler does for its own sake would arrive as a claim about their model.
 *
 * <p>So a reader is sent to the construct instead. {@link ShownBy} names which construct of the
 * model each condition is and what a run down the path would be seen doing there; a sentence says
 * which construct and which way it went, and the author reads their own comparison at the place it
 * points to.
 *
 * <p>Made once for both surfaces. A report and a warning say this differently — a report can name a
 * file and a diagnostic cannot — and what they may not do is read the rule apart twice, which is
 * how one of them would come to word a condition the other does not have.
 *
 * <p><b>Nothing is dropped.</b> A rule's conditions are what tell it from the rules beside it, and
 * two findings whose sentences say only which behavior they are of are two findings a reader cannot
 * act on. A condition with no construct to point at is said as that rather than left out, and never
 * stood in for by the proposition the account keys on.
