 * <p><b>The authority on how many points a line is resolved at, and not on how many rows go out.</b>
 * A point is one piece of work however many positions carry the type, and that is a rule about what
 * is owed rather than about how a block is laid out — so it is settled here, where the search is
 * resolved, and every reader below is a projection of this map. Left to the block, one authored line
 * comes out as up to four answers, one per reading that composed its own.
 *
 * <p>How many rows a person is offered is another count and is made further down: two points can be
 * answered by one row, and a block offers a row once per set of inputs ({@code GeneratedRows}). One
 * resolution per point does not mean one row per point.
 *
 * <p>In the order the lines were read, so that what a block prints is read against the one before
 * it.
 *
 * @param scope    which readings the request was about, which is also what settles the lines it is
 *                 about: a line no reading of the request's carries is not a question this was put.
 *                 Carried rather than left to each reader, because a reader deciding it a second
 *                 time is a reader that can decide it differently
 * @param resolved one answer per point of each line the scope admits
