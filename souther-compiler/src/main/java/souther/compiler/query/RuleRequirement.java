/**
 * What settles whether a rule of a body's decision is owed a row.
 *
 * <p>The three states ADR-0091 fixes, and they do not reduce to one another. A rule something has
 * been shown to stand in is required; one the model's own rules leave no value for is excluded;
 * one this compiler looked at without finding is neither, and stays where it was.
 *
 * <p><b>None of them is about what the rows do.</b> Whether an authored row takes a rule is the
 * coverage measure's question and is answered against the runs; this asks whether anything could
 * take it at all. A rule every row misses may be required, and a rule no value can reach is
 * excluded however the rows are written — the two questions are orthogonal, and a sentence here
 * that said "no row takes it" would put the coverage answer in the requirement's mouth.
 *
 * <p><b>What answers this is not one thing.</b> A search answers the first and the last, and it
 * cannot answer the middle: what a search came back with is always this compiler having looked, and
 * a model refusing a way is a fact the readings already hold. So the middle is its own shape here
 * rather than a word a search comes back with — written the other way round, a reader would have to
 * open a search's reason to find out whether the model said anything, and a reason added to that
 * vocabulary would change what the account means.
 *
 * <p><b>And a witness is not a row anybody is owed.</b> What a search built is evidence that the
 * rule can be reached; whether the rows written for the behavior reach it is the other question,
 * and a value this search built is in nobody's {@code example} block.
