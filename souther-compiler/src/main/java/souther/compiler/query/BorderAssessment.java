 * what a generation composes from. What is owed is not here — a line is owed once however many
 * positions read it — and what a finding is about, what a verdict counts and what a report marks is

 * entry that is not there. The measure used to be one record per obligation in a flat list, and two
 * of the four roles had no obligation to be in it — they were counted by the measure that counts a
 * position's classes, which is a different unit and has no word for a row on the far side of a line.
