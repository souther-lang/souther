/**
 * Everything measured about one behavior, and the one place what it went without is worked out.
 *
 * <p>A whole holds what its parts went without and decides nothing of its own. That was already the
 * rule (issue #953); what it lacked was somewhere to be. The union was written where the document is
 * assembled, over a list of measures named there — so the parts a behavior has were a list somebody
 * had to remember to add to, and the fourth of them was missing from it. A run that went without
 * something reached the document only through the three that were named, and a module every one of
 * which had nothing to be about reported {@code complete} beside a line saying a row of it did not
 * come back (issue #996).
 *
 * <p><b>The reading is one of the parts.</b> It is the measure of the rows themselves rather than a
 * measure counted over them, and it is the only one that can never be inapplicable — so it is what
 * carries a run's shortfall where every other part has nothing to be about. Which is the whole of
 * the fix: the parts are asked here, and the reading is one of them by being a field rather than by
 * anybody remembering it.
 *
 * <p><b>Null is the compile not having got far enough to be asked.</b> Three of these are absent
 * where the module never reached the query that answers them, which is not a measure that came back
 * with nothing: every measure that ran says why it has no number. The reading is always there,
 * because there is always an answer to how far the rows were read — including that nobody asked.
 *
 * <p><b>The lines are read here and accounted for beside it.</b> Which lines this behavior's
 * positions meet, and how far the reading that found them got, is one measure and is held once; what
 * this behavior is owed a row for at them is one account of it, and what the module's declarations
 * are owed is another. A reader that describes a border whole — a block that accounts for its four
 * points, a document that publishes them — reads the lines; a reader that measures this behavior
 * reads its account.
 *
 * @param reading          how far the reading of this behavior's rows got, and what it read
 * @param signature        what the rows establish about the cases of its inputs and its output
 * @param partition        what they establish about the classes
 * @param boundaryReadings every line its positions met, in every role, whosever the row at each
 *                         point is
