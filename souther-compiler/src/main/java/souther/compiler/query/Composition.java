/**
 * Everything the two searches composed, under the behavior each row is written for.
 *
 * <p>Where both halves meet. A behavior's own rows and the rows a declaration's line is owed are
 * composed by two searches asked in two ways, and they meet as work for one person: a line is one
 * piece of work and is offered once, in the terms of whichever reading composed it. Put together
 * where the block is written, the meeting was a step of the layout — so what a run offers could
 * only be said by printing it.
 *
 * <p><b>Not what a person is handed.</b> A row here may answer what another here answers, and which
 * of them goes out is settled by asking what each would settle. {@link Offering} is that answer, and
 * this is what it is made from — two types, because a renderer handed one of these would print rows
 * nobody chose, which is what the reduction exists to stop.
 *
 * <p>Nothing here is evidence of coverage. A row this holds is a question — these inputs, and what
 * does the system answer? — and what it would settle if it were written is not something this says.
 *
 * @param request  what was asked for, which is what settles which rows are here
 * @param rows     one entry per behavior with rows, in the order they were asked about
 * @param searched what each behavior's own search came to, keyed the way a report keys them
 * @param declared what the module's declarations are owed, or null where the request asked for no
 *                 boundary rows — which is not the same as a request that asked and found none
