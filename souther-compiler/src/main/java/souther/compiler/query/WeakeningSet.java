/**
 * Everything that leaves one measurement weaker than it looks, and the one way measurements are put
 * together.
 *
 * <p>A parent measure's account of itself is the union of what its parts went without. That is the
 * whole of the arithmetic: a report adding up nine measures asks each of them what weakened it and
 * unions the answers, where it used to ask each of them a boolean and rebuild the boolean from the
 * fields beside it.
 *
 * <p><b>A set of facts.</b> The same fact reaching a parent by two paths is one fact — a rule this
 * compiler could not read leaves the partition measure short at every position it bears on — and a
 * parent that reported it twice would be counting the paths. So union is idempotent, commutative
 * and associative, and two of these holding the same facts are one value.
 *
 * <p><b>And the fact is what the thing it is about says a fact is, never the value carrying it.</b>
 * Three of the arms hold more than the fact: an observation carries where it was met, a rule with
 * no line carries the handle an author is sent to, and a question that stands carries that handle
 * and what each reading of it was short of. Every one of those is declared, at the type that holds
 * it, to be no part of what tells one from another — so folded on the value they are two facts, and
 * the count, the entries of a verdict and the place a reader is sent to all follow whichever the
 * walk met first. What those carry is accumulated instead, and the accumulation is commutative, so
 * a fact met at two places is one fact citing both.
 *
 * <p>Which arm holds what is settled here, in one {@code switch} with no {@code default}. An arm
 * added later is a compile error until somebody says whether the value it holds is the fact.
 *
 * <p><b>No order.</b> Nothing here says which fact comes before which. What a document prints them
 * in is the order that document publishes the kind in, decided where the crossing to a sequence is
 * made and not by whatever a walk put them in.
 *
 * <p>A value, because these travel inside {@code Db} answers. An answer that never equals its own
 * recomputation is one {@code Db} reports as changed on every run, and everything that read it runs
 * again over a model nobody edited — which {@code MeasureClosure.Closed} was already arranged
 * against.
