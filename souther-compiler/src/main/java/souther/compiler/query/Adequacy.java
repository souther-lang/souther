     * about a case are projections of one universe of possible executions, and a derivation per
     * measure is a chance per measure to disagree.

     * <p>What this adds to {@link Reachable} is the conditions on the way. That one holds a
     * comparison against what the declarations leave a position, which is the same answer wherever
