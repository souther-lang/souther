     * <p><b>Work somebody asked for, and its own key for that reason.</b> Composing a value puts it
     * through this module's own decoders and costs a decoder run for each point it settles — 380 of
     * them and sixteen seconds on the corpus this was measured on, against a second for everything
     * else a build at {@code witness} does. A measurement everybody pays for may not carry that, and
     * an editor that wants the rows at one behavior's edges may not have to wait for every
     * behavior's.
     *
     * <p><b>Not a second assessment.</b> Every border, every demand, every coverage and every
     * projection is carried through untouched, and the only thing put in is the attempt at the
     * points the measurement itself says are worth one. So the two answers are ordered rather than
     * rival — this one holds strictly more evidence about the same lines, and a verdict read off
     * evidence can gain a witness and never lose one.
     *
     * <p><b>Asked of the readings, and folded after.</b> {@link Boundaries} is the same readings
     * folded, and a row is composed against the conditions the reading it is for is reached under —
     * so this takes {@link Readings} and folds what came back, which is the same fold and not a
     * second one. Taken from {@code Boundaries} instead, the conditions would be those of whichever
     * reading that fold kept. What keeps the two in this order is {@link LineReadings}: what a fold
     * gives back is not what a search takes.
     *
     * <p>Which is what lets it be asked later than the measurement, or not at all. Nobody having
     * asked is said by this key not having been asked, and not by an answer inside the measurement
