/**
 * The decision one behavior's body states, and which of its rules the rows took.
 *
 * <p>Two halves and one value, because the account is a function of the body and the rows together:
 * what rules there are is read off the body alone, and what stands in one is a row that took it.
 * Held apart, a reader would have to put them back together and would be free to put one body's
 * rules beside another's runs.
 *
 * <p><b>The second half is a measure, the way every other measure of a behavior is.</b> Which rules
 * the rows took is a question that can go unasked, be asked and come back with nothing readable, or
 * come back read in part — and those are the four states {@link Measure} already has. Written as a
 * sum of its own, the three nothings were one word with no weakening behind it: a build that read
 * no row and one whose rows are all placed and take none of the rules both said the rules are
 * uncovered, and a build refused over the first.
 *
 * @param read the rules the body states
 * @param took which of them the rows were seen taking, and how far that reading got
