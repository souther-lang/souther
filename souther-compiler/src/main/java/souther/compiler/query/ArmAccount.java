/**
 * Every arm one behavior is owed a row for, with what was found out about each and about the set.
 *
 * <p>Made once, from what was observed, and read one way. What the rows lit, which forks stand for a
 * number of rules nobody established, and which proofs a row has already shown wrong are three
 * first-hand facts, and each of them is written onto the thing it is about: the first onto the arm
 * it lit, the second onto the arms of the fork it is about, the third onto the census. A
 * measurement assembled over this reads {@link #weakening()} and carries the reasons on; nothing
 * reads them back to work out what an arm's state was.
 *
 * <p>Which is the whole of the arrangement. Held the other way round — one set of reasons for the
 * measurement, and every surface deciding for itself which of them bears on what — an arm nothing
 * reaches stopped being reported because a helper elsewhere in the body could not be told apart, and
 * a reading that stopped in one row was printed as a word over every arm of the behavior.
 *
 * <p>Not public, and that is the boundary rather than a habit. This is where the measurement's own
 * weakening comes from, and a consumer that could reach it could work an arm's state out of the
 * reasons a second time. What leaves this package is {@link ArmSummary}, which has the groups and
 * the census and no way to the provenance.
