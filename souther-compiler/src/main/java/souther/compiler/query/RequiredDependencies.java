/**
 * What a row of one behavior has to stand in for, in the order the behavior requires them.
 *
 * <p>One answer to two questions a search asks. Composing a candidate has to know which dependencies
 * need an answer at all — every one the target requires, whether or not the body decides on what it
 * answers — and running one has to hand them over in the order the injecting constructor takes
 * them. Worked out twice, a row would be composed for one list and applied against another, and the
 * mismatch would read as a behavior nothing applies.
 *
 * <p>The signature is the dependency's own, taken from what this module reaches rather than from
 * what it declares: a dependency another module declares is still the behavior a stand-in stands
 * where.
