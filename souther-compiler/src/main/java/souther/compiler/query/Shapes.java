/**
 * What each declaration becomes before anything is checked against it, one achievement to a rung:
 * the clauses it wrote expanded to the rules they state ({@link Settling}), the constructions in
 * those clauses written as constructions ({@link NormalizedDeclarations}), and a product's boundary
 * representation read off its declared shape ({@link DerivedDeclarations}).
 *
 * <p>Three rungs and not one, because the three have different preconditions and a reader wants
 * different ones. Normalizing is declaration-local and is answered for every declaration a module
 * writes; deriving a representation reads what the fields name, and a product one of whose fields
 * names no type has none. So a declaration is read as the normalized one whether or not a
 * representation came out — the answers a reader gets do not turn on a question it did not ask.
 *
 * <p>These used to be passes over a whole module in a fixed order, and getting that order wrong was
 * its own class of defect. Here the order is not written anywhere: each answer names what it reads,
 * and reading it is what makes it happen first.

     * have to be in hand before it starts — so gathered while it walks, every count taken anywhere
