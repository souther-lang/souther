     * <p>The other half of what {@link #symbols} hands out, and the half issue #835 is about.
     * Handing over the table meant asking {@link Meanings} to build a scope, so every reader of a
     * scope depended on every name in the module before reading one of them — and what a body check
     * reads of them is almost always nothing, because the names it is checked over were resolved a
     * representation earlier and it reads the declarations they denote one at a time. Asked here, a
     * body that reads no meaning depends on none of them, and the report that reads every name in
     * sight depends on every name in sight, which is what it is about.
     * {@code IncrementalCompilationTest} holds the pair.
     *
     * <p>Built where it is used and never kept, for the reason {@link Key} gives: it reads this
     * store, so two of them are the same when the store is, which says where they came from and not
     * what they say. The reads it makes land on whichever question was being answered when it made
     * them.
     *
     * <p>The store is asked every time and not once. What is kept is the reading built over the
     * answer, and it is kept only while the answer is the one it was built over — so a scope read
     * after an edit answers from what the module means now, and one read many times while a single
     * question is being answered builds the reading once. Fetched once instead, this would hold a
     * snapshot for as long as it lived, and whether that could be read after an edit would be a
     * fact about who kept a scope rather than one this can be sure of on its own.
     *
     * <p>Where this compilation has no such module, every spelling means nothing — the answer
     * {@link Denoting#NONE} gives. Nothing reading a scope learns that a compilation can be missing
     * a module, and nothing here has to hold an absence it would have to decide what to do with:
     * {@link HasScope} is what a reader is told, before it has a scope at all.
