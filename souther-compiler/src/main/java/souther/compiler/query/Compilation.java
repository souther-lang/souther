     * leads. That is not this order failing to find the cause: a cause is not recoverable from two
     * positions, and a secondary diagnostic is the checker's to withhold where it should not be said
     * at all. This decides how the errors are presented; whether one of them should have been
     * reported is the checker's own question.
     *
     * <p>Not public. The reports a surface reads are the ones {@link #reports()} answers, and a
