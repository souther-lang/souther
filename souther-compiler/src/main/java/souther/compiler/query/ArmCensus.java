/**
 * Whether the arms this account holds are all the arms it is owed.
 *
 * <p>A second question beside where each arm stands, and not a shade of it. Which arms a behavior
 * owes a row for is worked out from the model's own proofs about what can reach what: an arm nothing
 * arrives at is instrumented and is not owed, because no row can light it. Where a row lights one of
 * those anyway, nothing about the model is wrong and the proof is — and what that bears on is the
 * denominator, not any one arm. A row through an arm went through it however wrong a proof about a
 * neighbouring arm turned out to be.
 *
 * <p>Held apart for that reason. Folded into the arms, a disproved proof would take every arm's
 * answer with it: the arms a row certainly does not reach would stop being reported over an analysis
 * that was wrong somewhere else in the body, which is the shape this account exists to keep out.
