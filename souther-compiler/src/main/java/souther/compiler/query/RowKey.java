/**
 * What tells one piece of work from another among the rows a run offers.
 *
 * <p>The row as a person is handed it: the behavior it is written under and the values it is written
 * with, in the form they will be written in. A candidate is composed once per thing it is owed for
 * and the positions that thing does not name hold whatever the row has to hold, so two of them come
 * out as one piece of work — and what a reader would otherwise be pasting twice is one row here.
 *
 * <p><b>What is written, and not what the values are.</b> Two rows of one behavior that mean the
 * same thing and are spelt differently stay two rows, each answering what it was composed for. That
 * is the direction to be wrong in: a person reads the row, and an identity over the values would
 * need something none of them has — a fixture carries the position it was parsed at and the path it
 * was constructed through, neither of which is what a reader is looking at.
 *
 * <p>Under one behavior, because a row is written in one behavior's terms. The same values written
 * for two behaviors are two rows in two blocks, and a key that left the behavior out would join them
 * into one piece of work nobody can write.
 *
 * @param behavior the behavior the row is written under
 * @param written  one value per parameter, as the source an author is handed
