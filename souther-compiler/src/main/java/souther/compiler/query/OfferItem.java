 * point of a line are is already settled — each of them is a value some other part of this compiler
 * owns — and this puts them where one question can be asked of all three: which of them does a row
 * this run offers settle?
 *
 * <p><b>Nothing of an identity is written again here.</b> A wrapper that spelled out an axis and a
 * class id, a probe, or a line and a role would be a second answer to what tells two of them apart —
 * and the third would be wrong the day a point stopped being a line and a role, which it already
 * has: two points of one line and one role are two things where the sides they are inside of are
 * different. So each arm holds the value and adds nothing to it, and every arm holds exactly one.
