/**
 * A row that was written down, read as the two things every question here is put to.
 *
 * <p>The values are built through the module's own decoders and the account is what running it
 * recorded. Both of them are how a row a person is being handed is put to the same walks a row in
 * the file goes through — and there is one of these because there is one way to read a row: a
 * second reading built where a second caller needed it would be free to answer differently about
 * one row.
 *
 * <p>Made once per row rather than once per question. A row read again for the next item would be
 * run again for it, which is the same row doing the same thing as many times as somebody has
 * questions.
 *
 * @param values      what its inputs build to, or null where they do not all build
 * @param whyNotRead  why they did not, where they did not, and null where they did
 * @param watched     what running it recorded, which a row whose values would not build still has:
 *                    the two are found out separately and one failing is not the other failing
