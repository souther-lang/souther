/**
 * The store a compilation's questions are asked of: it answers a {@link Key} by running it once,
 * keeps the answer, and hands the same answer to everyone who asks again.
 *
 * <p>It also watches. While a key is being answered, every key it asks is recorded against it, so
 * afterwards the graph knows what each answer was built from. That is what makes a question
 * depending on itself visible at the moment it happens rather than as a stack overflow, and it is
 * what lets an edit be absorbed: change a source, and the only answers recomputed are the ones that
 * read something that changed.
 *
 * <p>Recomputing is not the same as changing. An answer that comes out equal to the one it replaces
 * leaves everything that read it alone — which is what keeps an edit local. Retyping a helper's body
 * changes that module's classes; it does not change what the module declares, so nothing that
 * imports it is looked at again.
 *
 * <p>That rests on the answers being values, and two of them carry it. {@link Front.Layout} is what
 * stops an edit to any source from reaching the whole workspace: every parse feeds it, and it comes
 * out the same. {@link Names.Declarations} is what stops an edit at the module boundary: an importer
 * builds against what a module declares, not against its bodies. Both are maps of records, and
 * {@code IncrementalCompilationTest} pins both.
 *
 * <p>A module's classes carry it too. Each is a {@link souther.compiler.jvm.ClassFileImage}, which
 * is what its bytes say, so a module regenerated to what it already was leaves the examples that
 * load it alone. What that does not reach is an example of one module and an edit to another it
 * merely imports: the classes it is run against are the ones its module reaches, so they change
 * when any of those does. Narrowing that to the classes an example actually loads is per-definition
 * work and is not here.
 *
 * <p>Two rules run through the rest of them, and an answer can break either one.
 *
 * <p>A computed node is a value. What {@code equals} says is what stops work, so such an answer says
 * what it means and not where it came from; one that never equals the answer it replaces leaves
 * nothing downstream of it ever kept, while every test of what the compiler says stays green. That
 * rules out a kind of thing and not a missing method: an object that reads this store when it is
 * asked — a registry, a scope over one, a loader — is the same as another when the store is, which
 * is where it came from. Those are built inside a {@code compute} and used there, which is also what
 * makes their reads land on the question being answered. {@link Names#derivedSymbols} is one, handed
 * out and not kept.
 *
 * <p>A supplied node is whatever was supplied. An {@link Input} is not computed and its answer is
 * what somebody handed in, so what its equality decides is not whether a compile came to the same
 * thing — it is whether the outside changed. A way of running something may be handed in that way
 * and there is no compute to build it inside; what it costs is that a new one reads as a change,
 * which is a conservative answer about the outside rather than a wrong answer about a compile.
 *
 * <p>{@code EverythingAnAnswerHoldsMeansSomethingTest} is what says which answers still break the
 * first rule, and {@code EveryAnswerThisCompilerDeclaresIsSettledTest} what says which of the two a
 * question is read under.
 *
 * <p>An edge is what its consumer means. A collection gathered per module is an index, and a
 * question asked per definition depends on the entries it reaches rather than on the index. Read
 * whole, an index hands the finer question the coarser one's identity: an edit anywhere in the
 * module — or in a module it imports — arrives as an edit to every definition in it, and again no
 * test of what the compiler answers can see the difference. Keeping the index is fine, and so is
 * reading one to answer a question about a single entry — {@link Bodies.Stated} does exactly that.
 * What a per-definition question may not do is take the index as its own dependency.
 *
 * <p>Which does not mean every producer has to be split. What the consumer reads has to stop where
 * its meaning stops, and a key between the two is where that happens: the broad answer is
 * recomputed as often as its own inputs move, and the cut is what the consumer depends on.
 * {@link Names.Meanings} is what a module's names mean, cut from the whole assembly they are read
 * off — so declaring a behavior, which adds a value name, stops there. {@link Bodies.CalleeSigsForBody}
 * is the signatures one body names, cut from its module's index of everything callable in it.
 * {@link Bodies.ContractsForBody} is a body's contracts asked entry by entry.
 *
 * <p>A cut is one way to stop an index short of a reader. The other is to hand the reader the
 * questions rather than the table, so that the index is asked for when it is read and not when it
 * is built — which is what {@link souther.compiler.check.Registry} does for a module's declarations
 * and {@link souther.compiler.check.Denoting} for what its names mean. It answers what a cut cannot
 * here: which of a module's meanings a body needs is a question about what a body's scope is, and
 * nothing has to decide it, because a body that reads none of them depends on none of them and the
 * one report that reads every name in sight depends on every name in sight. That is issue #835,
 * and {@code IncrementalCompilationTest} holds both halves.
 *
 * <p>One store is one workspace over time, not one compile. It is not thread-safe and does not need
 * to be: the work inside a compile is a graph walk, not a set of independent jobs.
