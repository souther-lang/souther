/**
 * Everything known about one point a row is owed at: what it asks, and what all the readings of it
 * came to.
 *
 * <p>What a report prints, what a build refuses over and what an editor offers are readings of
 * these. A {@link BorderAssessment} beside one is a border as some position of some behavior met it,
 * and there is one of those per position of every behavior carrying the type. Answered from an
 * occurrence, one clause of {@code UserId} is 126 things to write a row for over {@code crm}.
 *
 * <p><b>Every point, whosever it is.</b> Whether a row here is a body's to write or is owed to the
 * declarations that drew the line is what {@link souther.compiler.partition.PointAttribution}
 * answers, and it decides who keeps the account and where a row goes — not whether the readings of
 * the point are gathered. Made for one of the two, the other kind had no value naming its readings
 * at all, and its one row was offered for whichever reading a walk wrote last. So the readings are
 * gathered here for both, and whose the point is is read off this rather than asked before it.
 *
 * <p><b>One of these per point and not per line.</b> A line owes as many as four things and they are
 * not one piece of work: a row at the line and a row beside it are two values, and two runs beside
 * one line that stop in different places are two obligations, whether or not one row answers both.
 * Which of them a reading owes is the
 * border's own answer ({@link souther.compiler.partition.Border#owes}), so nothing here decides it
 * again — and a line has no assessment of its own, only the points it owes. A report that shows a
 * border whole groups these by the line and joins them with the border's four answers, because a
 * role nobody is owed a row in has no point here to be found by.
 *
 * <p><b>And a point has no word for where it is.</b> Where on the quantity the rule cut is part of
 * what a point is, and it is published as the identity it is. What it has no word for is a
 * <em>reader's</em> spelling of that place, because writing one takes a quantity and a quantity is
 * a reading's: a distance writes its levels as how far the row stands from the other position —
 * {@code d.to - 1} — and which position that is differs between the readings. Over {@code crm} one
 * point of one line has twenty-five such spellings. Written from the level alone instead, the
 * number comes out true and unreadable: the {@code ON} point of {@code from < to} is a distance of
 * −1, which is no value any position holds and nothing an author can write. So a point says which
 * of the four it is and which rule drew the line, and every word with a quantity in it is said
 * under it by the reading whose quantity it is ({@link #readingsSaid}). A line a declaration drew
 * is the exception the author makes: there the quantity is one they wrote, and {@link #said(String)}
 * takes it from them.
 *
 * <p><b>What is owed is the same at every reading, and that is checked rather than folded.</b> A
 * {@link Demand} is what the point asks — a criterion over the levels of the quantity the line cut,
 * or a reason no row is asked for — and none of it is about where the line was read. So two readings
 * of one point that disagree about it have not disagreed: something has called two points one, and
 * the identity is what is wrong. Joined instead — the stronger demand winning, or the two merged —
 * that mistake would come out as a report asking for a row at a point some other line owns.
