/**
 * Which number of a behavior's input an expression names, or nothing where it names none.
 *
 * <p>The companion of {@link InputPath}, one question further in. That answers which location an
 * expression points at; this answers which number a rule about it is written on, which is the
 * location's own content or something taken of it — and the two are not the same answer, because a
 * position holding a string is a position holding no number while every rule about its length is
 * about one.
 *
 * <p>One answer, for every reader that has to say which number a comparison is about. The reading
 * that draws lines and the reading that names what a run was steered by both ask it, and each
 * working it out for itself is two accounts of one number: matched afterwards by how a path is
 * spelled, two numbers taken of one location are one, which is the whole of what a line drawn on
 * the second of them is lost to.
 *
 * <p>Which of the standard library's calls take a number of a location is asked of
 * {@link NumericMeasures} rather than decided here, and asked of the operation the call resolved to
 * rather than of its spelling.

     * value per element of what it was given is a fact about the operation that handed the closure
     * its elements, proved before the tree was rewritten. Where in an element the answer stands is
     * what the closure came to, read once and kept as the way there. And which position the
     * elements are at is the reading of the input's, as it is for every other term.
     *
     * <p>What the walk itself supplies is the element's binding and nothing more. The form it has
     * now is what a rewrite left, so it is asked for an identity and not for a meaning: reading the
     * answer off the shape would make the walks a rule can be written over a consequence of which
     * ones that rewrite happens to recognise, and a walk an author wrote by hand would be read as
     * a {@code map}.
     *
     * <p>The walk is met under whatever name is in scope, and what a name stands for is asked of
     * the reading that owns the question ({@link InputReads#meaningOf}) rather than read off the
     * tree. A model of any size binds the mapped list before totalling it, and a route that walked
     * only the expression as written would answer one thing for
     * {@code List.sum(List.map(f, xs))} and another for the same rule with a name in the middle —
     * which is a `let` changing what a model means. The environment the value was given in comes
     * with it, so what is read of the walk afterwards is read where the walk stands.
     *
     * <p>Null wherever any of the three is missing, which is a rule this compiler did not read
     * rather than a rule the model does not state — and is reported as one. Null too where the three
     * are in hand and what they come to is not one run
     * ({@link RunSource#overTheOccurrencesAt}), which is the same answer for the same reason: a
     * reading short rather than a line somewhere it does not go.
