/**
 * Which position of a behavior's input an expression names, and that it names none where it names
 * none ({@link PathResolution}).
 *
 * <p>One answer, for every reader of a body that has something to say about a position. A
 * {@code guard} comparing a field, a {@code match} on a parameter and an arm declaring a case
 * cannot arrive are three statements about the same positions, and each working out for itself
 * which position it was talking about is three spellings of one path — of which the axes carry one,
 * so the other two would be about positions nothing measures.
 *
 * <p><b>Asked of the binding and never of the spelling.</b> A body may bind a name its own behavior
 * already binds, and the two are different values under one word: {@code let f = defaulted(f)}
 * leaves every read below it naming the local, whose values are whatever the call answers with.
 * Read by name, the reads below it are the parameter's, and what is said about the parameter's rules
 * is said about a value they never reached ({@link BindingId} states this for every reader at once).
 *
 * <p><b>Two kinds of step and no third.</b> Descending an expression — a field's target, a call's
 * argument — stays inside one finite tree and needs nothing to stop it. Crossing to another
 * expression goes through a binding: what a name holds, what handed a name the elements of a
 * container, which binding another's elements are the same as. Those steps are a walk over the
 * binding graph and {@link BindingTrail} is the whole of what stops them, so a step added here is
 * one of the two and never a share of somebody's allowance. Nothing counts how far a walk has come:
 * a count of how many names a reading may pass through is a count of how a model was written, and
 * one name more than it allows is a position this reports as one nothing names.
 *
 * <p><b>What a name is decides which step is taken, and one step is taken.</b> A binding is a
 * parameter, or what an operation handed an element of a container on, or what a name was given, in
 * that order and asked once ({@link BindingRole}). A binding can be more than one: two walks over one
 * collection joined into one leave the second walk's element bound to what the first walk's closure
 * made. Tried as roads and raced, the winner is whichever reaches a position, and there it is the
 * value the rewrite left under the name — a rule about a value <em>made from</em> a position read as
 * a rule about the position. So an element is answered by its container and by nothing beside it,
 * whatever that answer comes to.
 *
 * <p>An expression that binds a name of its own is descended under that name. That is what a
 * {@code let} means, and it is what a helper applied to an argument is left as; a shape a splice
 * happens to leave is not a reason to stop, and stopping there left every claim inside an expanded
 * helper about a position nothing here could name.
 *
 * <p>What is known of the names comes in as answers and nothing else ({@link BindingEnvironment}).
 * How many names there are is not a fact about how far a value's provenance runs — a name bound in
 * an arm is read under bindings written elsewhere — and a reading of what a name means is built on
 * this one rather than beside it, so neither is something a walk here can reach for.
 *
 * <p>Nothing about the reading of an input reaches this and nothing here reaches it: what a position
 * can hold is read from the declarations ({@link InputDomain}), and this only says which position an
 * expression is pointing at.
