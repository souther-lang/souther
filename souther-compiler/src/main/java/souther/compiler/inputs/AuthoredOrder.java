/**
 * Some of one kind of thing, in the order the author wrote what raised them.
 *
 * <p>The claim, made where it can be made. Nothing in a list says where its order came from — the
 * walk that found the members, or the person who wrote them — and between those two lies the whole
 * of what a reader may do with it: one is a fact about the model and the other is a fact about a
 * traversal. So the claim is stated by making one of these, and it is stated where the order is
 * still known.
 *
 * <p><b>Which is why this is here and not beside the document.</b>
 * {@link souther.compiler.publish.SourceOrdered} is the same claim at the crossing into a report,
 * and it used to be made there — by a projection handed a bare list, two packages from anything
 * that had seen the source. It was true while every member came from one producer and stopped being
 * true when a second arrived, with nothing in a position to notice. A projection maps one of these
 * to the words a document writes and states nothing about the order, because it has nothing to
 * state it from.
 *
 * <p>Each member once, keeping the first place it was written at. Two parts one limit stopped are
 * one thing to lift and one entry, and the entry is where the first of them stands.
 *
 * @param <T> what is held in the author's order
