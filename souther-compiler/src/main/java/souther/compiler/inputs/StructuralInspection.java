/**
 * Whether a position stands once what is under it has been read, and how the reading goes on from
 * it.
 *
 * <p><b>A continuation and not a classifier.</b> The derivation reads what a position's own type
 * says first — the classes it divides into, the ends its rules put on it — and only where that says
 * nothing does it ask what is under the position. So this is reached after local evidence is
 * exhausted, never instead of it, and an answer here says nothing about what the local reading
 * found. A sum answers {@link Retained} with branches under it, and a sum is the position most
 * likely to have had classes: the answer means the sum is not made of positions, not that nothing
 * divides it.
 *
 * <p><b>Two answers, and the difference between them is what becomes of the position.</b> A
 * {@link Decomposed} position is given up in favour of what is under it: a record states no
 * distinction of its own and carries no end, so nothing is read there that a reader would have to
 * weigh against its fields. Everything else is {@link Retained} — the position stands, whatever the
 * reading goes on to do below it.
 *
 * <p><b>Retained is not an absence, and neither is any continuation of one.</b> Whether the position
 * divides is still open when one comes back, because the rules a behavior's body writes have not
 * been read yet — a bare {@code List<String>} nothing bounds continues into its elements and is
 * still undivided until a {@code guard List.length(t.names) > 0} draws a line on it, and a
 * {@link Continuation.Blocked} is the reason the position would be left with if nothing else
 * answered for it rather than a verdict. Nothing here may be turned into a report of a position the
 * model does not divide; that conclusion needs the phases after this one to have finished too.
