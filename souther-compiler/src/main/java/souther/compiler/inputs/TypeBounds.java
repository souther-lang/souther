     * the type said so or the record did. That is the difference from {@link LocalInspection}'s axis bounds: a cap the
     * record alone imposes is not a line dividing this position, and it is still where its values

     * <p>Numbers and no names. An end here says where the values stop; which rule put it there is a
     * cut's question, and answering it from a projection would name a rule that never mentioned this
     * position on its own.
     *
     * <p>A size is never negative and nothing has to write that down (spec
     * §invariant-discharge-terms). Kept here with the rules rather than at the boundary that reads
     * them, so that a guard at zero is refused its neighbour below by the same intersection that
     * refuses one outside an invariant.
