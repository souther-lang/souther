/**
 * One conjunct of a declaration's clause that placed no end, and where the value it is written about
 * stands.
 *
 * <p>What the reading of a behavior's input hands to the reading that draws lines. A clause bounding
 * one coordinate leaves an end behind and is read through that; one relating two coordinates leaves
 * nothing, and it is still a rule about where this behavior's values part — so it is handed over as
 * the clause it is, to be read where a line is drawn.
 *
 * <p><b>Nothing here says what the clause comes to.</b> Which of these draws a line is settled by
 * the reading that draws it, in that reading's own atoms, and the word the reading of ends had for
 * why it placed none is no part of the question: the two read one clause with different atoms, and a
 * clause over a number one of them has no atom for is one the other names two positions in.
 *
 * @param rule     which clause of which declaration
 * @param conjunct where in that clause this conjunct is, counted from zero over every conjunct the
 *                 clause has. What tells one authored line from another is the pair, and a reader
 *                 holding the expression alone cannot tell two identical conjuncts apart
 * @param part     the conjunct itself
 * @param at       where the value the clause is written about stands. The clause binds each field of
 *                 the declaration that wrote it, and a field an include brought in keeps that
 *                 declaration's binding, so the names under this path are what the clause reads
 *                 whichever declaration wrote it
 * @param readUnder the declaration this reading was made under, which is not always the one the
 *                 clause was written on. A name wrapped round a record is a governing declaration of
 *                 its own and the record's clauses are read under it, so what its reads are bound to
 *                 is that name's — matched against the writing declaration's bindings alone, a
 *                 clause under a name names no position at all
