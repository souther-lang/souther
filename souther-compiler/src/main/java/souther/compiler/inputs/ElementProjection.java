 * element, some value made from it; where that value is a place inside the element, this is the way
 * there and the expression is not kept. Held as the expression, every reader of a run would be
 * reading a body the inliner happened to leave, and what may be read off one would grow with
 * whatever the inliner does next.
 *
 * <p>Relative, so it can be joined to whichever element position the run turns out to be over. The
 * closure was written about one element and the run is over all of them, and the two meet by this
 * being the part that does not depend on which.
 *
 * <p>Steps of a path and no other kind. A closure answering something built rather than something
 * read has no projection and is not one of these — which is what keeps a rule about what a branch
 * chose from being read as a rule about a field.

     *
     * <p>Read here and not where a position of the input is worked out. That reading asks which
     * position of a behavior's input an expression names and has the roots, the containers and the
     * provenance of elements to answer with; this one asks where inside one value another value
     * stands, and a name, a {@code let} and a field are the whole of what it takes. Answered by the
     * same walk, the steps that reach a behavior's parameters would be reachable from here, and the
     * relative way inside an element would quietly become an absolute one.
     *
     * <p><b>Null wherever the answer is not read out of the element.</b> A branch chooses between
     * two of them and is neither; arithmetic over one is a value the element does not hold; a
     * construction is something new. None of those is a place a row writes, so a rule about what a
     * walk answered is not a rule about any position, and saying so is this reading's whole job on
     * that side.
     *
     * <p>Nothing here says the answer is one per element. That is a fact about the operation that
     * handed the closure its elements, proved where that operation stood; a caller wanting a run
     * needs both, and this is the half about the reading.
