/**
 * Where a number taken over a run of values runs.
 *
 * <p>A total stands at no position, so nothing published about a position says where it runs. What
 * does say is the run: as many values as stand at the path it reads from, each of them one of them,
 * put together by the step the operation repeats from the value it starts at.
 *
 * <p><b>Two facts and a theorem, and none of the three is written here.</b> What the operation
 * starts from and repeats is {@code semantics.Accumulation}, declared once for a reader that
 * discharges a rule and a reader that measures a model alike. What every value the run walks
 * guarantees is {@link ValueGuarantees}, which is what the discharge check reads of a container's
 * elements in the same words. That a walk cannot leave a range whose seed is inside it and whose
 * step stays inside it is {@link Induction}. This is the projection of the first two onto the third,
 * and there is no sentence here saying that a total of amounts at or above nought is at or above
 * nought — that follows, and follows for whatever the model declares rather than for the case
 * somebody wrote down.
 *
 * <p><b>What the values guarantee, and never what a context leaves them.</b> A run walks every
 * occurrence of its path and fixes no case and no condition, so what may be assumed of the value at
 * one of them is what holds of every value of its type. A reading narrowed by which case a value
 * turned out to be would be a bound half the occurrences are outside.
 *
 * <p>Nothing is read off how many the container holds. The induction does not have that as an input,
 * so a total of amounts at or above nought is at or above nought whether the list holds none of them
 * or a thousand — the empty container answers the seed, and the seed is inside the range or the range
 * is not proved.
