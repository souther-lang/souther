/**
 * One rule of the model, at one position it is about, that this did not turn into a line.
 *
 * <p>Asked of the rule, and it names one. One position carries more than one statement, and a line
 * read at it says nothing about the rest — a threshold on {@code x} does not answer for the bound
 * beside it that nothing could read. Carrying only the position, the sentence written from this
 * told an author that a rule about {@code r.cost} went unread and left them to find which rule; and
 * two rules with no line at one position came out as one line, which is what a finding asked of the
 * rule may not do.
 *
 * <p><b>Whichever rule drew it.</b> A {@code guard}'s comparison, a newtype's invariant and a
 * clause of an {@code ensures} are three producers of one kind of evidence (spec
 * §example-partition), so a reader of this list is told the same thing about any of them and does
 * not have to know which wrote it. Named after the guard while only guards produced one, an
 * invariant nothing could read had nowhere to be said and was dropped in silence — the position
 * then came back as one the model divides no way, which is the opposite of what the declaration
 * says.
 *
 * <p>The rule once, and the questions that place it beside it. What a reader groups by is the rule
 * ({@link Fact}); what an author acts on is a handle, which is that rule together with one of those
 * questions, and {@link #cited} makes them rather than keeping them. Kept, a handle would be a
 * second answer to which rule this is about, free to be of another one.
 *
 * <p><b>Named for what is true of everything in it.</b> Two opposite things bring a rule here — one
 * this compiler got partway through, and one it read from end to end that draws no line — and what
 * they have in common is the whole of what this says: at this position, this rule is no line. Which
 * of the two it was is {@code why}, and it is asked of the type rather than read back out of a
 * word.
 *
 * <p><b>And neither of them is what holds a measure of coverage open.</b> That is a question about
 * a rule, which the reading that classifies the rule raises; this is what a report says about what
 * became of a rule here. Counted as the first, a rule this compiler read completely is one nobody
 * could read.
 *
 * @param fact      which rule, at which position, and why there is no line — the whole of what makes
 *                  two of these one finding ({@link Fact})
 * @param reachedBy every question a reader was offered for the rule, because a rule found by two
 *                  readers is one finding and each of them says how to reach it; which of them a
 *                  document writes is that document's to decide. Empty exactly where the author
 *                  named the rule, which is found by that name from anywhere
