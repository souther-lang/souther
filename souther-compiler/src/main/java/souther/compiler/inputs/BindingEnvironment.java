/**
 * What is known of the names in a tree, as answers to the questions a walk over them asks.
 *
 * <p>Two readings are built out of this and they are not the same reading. What a name stands for
 * ({@link ReadMeaning}) is one, and which position of the input an expression reaches
 * ({@link InputPath}) is the other; the first is written in terms of the second, and both are
 * written in terms of what is here.
 *
 * <p><b>Facts and never an answer.</b> A reading held here would be reachable from the reading built
 * on it, and the two would call each other: what a name means is worked out by asking which position
 * it reaches, so a walk after a position that could ask what a name means would be asking a question
 * whose answer it is. Kept to facts, that is not something a caller can write.
 *
 * <p><b>And the facts themselves do not come back.</b> Which of them wins where a binding is more
 * than one of them, and what an edge between two bindings' elements licenses, are decisions with one
 * place each ({@link BindingRole}, {@link souther.compiler.check.ElementProvenance#stepFrom}) —
 * and a caller holding the tables would be free to make them again, in an order or with a licence of
 * its own. So what is published is the questions, and the tables are not among them.
 *
 * <p>Which is also what keeps a traversal from measuring itself against the environment. How many
 * names are known here is not how far a value's provenance runs — a name bound in one arm is read
 * under bindings written elsewhere — and there is nothing to count with: what stops a walk over
 * these facts is where it has been ({@link BindingTrail}), never how much there is.
 *
 * <p>A value, compared by what it holds. It travels inside a reading, which is compared the same
 * way, and an identity that told two equal environments apart would make a name's meaning depend on
 * which copy of them a caller had.
