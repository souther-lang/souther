/**
 * What can arrive at each position of one behavior's input, read once.
 *
 * <p>The single answer four measures are projections of. What cases a signature is owed, what
 * classes a position divides into, what arms a row is owed and what a body's {@code unreachable}
 * claims are held against all come from here — derived separately they disagreed, and the disagreement
 * had a direction: the reading that knew about the rules refused a case, and the reading that knew
 * only the type asked for a row at it.
 *
 * <p><b>The walk is here and not in a reader.</b> A reader with its own walk has its own set of
 * positions, and a position one of them never visited is one it can say nothing about while another
 * answers for it. So every position a behavior's input has is read, whatever any reader goes on to
 * do with it — including the ones a reader gives up in favour of what is under them, and the ones
 * dropped past a budget.
 *
 * <p>Which is a claim about the reading and not about the step it is made of. What stands directly
 * under a type is one fact and is {@link StructuralDescent}'s; how far to follow it, and what is
 * read where it lands, are this reading's. A reader wanting the step alone
 * takes it from there, and takes none of the meaning here with it.
 *
 * <p><b>A position may exist only under a narrowing of another.</b> What a case of a sum declares is
 * declared whether or not anything constructs one, so those fields are positions of the input and are
 * read here — at a path carrying the narrowing they stand under ({@link Refinement}), which is what
 * says a row has to be that case for them to be reached at all. Which branches are walked is settled
 * by what the position came back owing rather than by what its type has: a case the rules refuse has
 * no positions to cover, exactly as a value whose rules contradict has none.
 *
 * <p><b>How far down it goes is settled by the declarations and not by a count.</b> Every path that
 * opens no declaration twice is followed to its end, however many steps that is: how deeply an
 * author nests a record decides nothing about whether the rules written at the bottom of it are
 * measured. What ends a path is returning to a declaration already open on it ({@link
 * ExpansionTrace}) — the occurrence is read, and only unfolding it again is refused. Held to a
 * number of steps instead, a rule one step past that number drew no line, and a threshold an author
 * had written once was never asked for.
 *
 * <p><b>And a reading is closed over the finite paths the behavior's measurement names.</b> Two
 * roads reach a position and both are taken here. Enumeration asks what positions a type can have
 * and answers without reference to any body, which is why it has to stop somewhere; a demand
 * ({@link InputDemand}) names one path, adds nothing to the enumeration, and ends because the path
 * does. Both are read by the same walk and the same reading of the declarations, so what comes back
 * is one account of one input.
 *
 * <p>Once built, a reading never acquires another position, rule root or constraint. Everything
 * derived from it — what a report counts, what the rules leave a quantity, what a row is asked
 * for — is taken from it once and cannot be told about a position afterwards, so a reading that
 * grew one when somebody looked it up would answer a question by what had been asked before it. A
 * path nobody demanded is a path this has no position for, whoever asks and whenever.
 *
 * <p><b>Where a value is built is still not one of these positions.</b> The generator goes on until
 * there is a value to build, which is further down than a report is about. Those paths are written the
 * same way and are about something else, so they are never looked up here.
 *
 * <p>Nothing a body writes reaches this. A {@code guard}'s line, a {@code match} arm and an
 * {@code unreachable} are statements about the same positions and are read against this rather than
 * into it — which is what keeps a body from moving the denominator it is measured by.
