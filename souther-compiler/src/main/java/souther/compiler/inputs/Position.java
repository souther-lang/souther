/**
 * One position of a behavior's input, read once.
 *
 * <p>What every measure means by "what can arrive here". The cases a signature is owed, the classes
 * a position divides into, the arms a row is owed and the claims a body makes about a case are four
 * questions with one answer behind them, and four derivations of that answer are four chances to
 * disagree — which is how a report came to ask for a row at a case its own rules refuse.
 *
 * <p><b>Settled questions only.</b> What is published here is what was decided, not what it was
 * decided from: the reading itself stays inside this package. Handed the readings, each caller
 * would interpret them again, and a fifth derivation is what this exists to stop.
 *
 * <p>Reached through {@link InputDomain} and nowhere else. There is no way to write one of these
 * down, which is the whole of what keeps the answer single: a caller cannot assemble a position
 * out of a claim a body made, and a widening cannot be applied twice because it is applied where
 * the position is made.
