/**
 * What the readers found about the rules that came to no line here, and the rules among them
 * nothing worked out the questions of.
 *
 * <p>A value and not the thing that gathered it. What a reader hands on is compared, held beside
 * other answers and carried into records that compare by their fields, so a mutable gathering handed
 * out under this name would be a value whose equality is identity and whose contents anyone holding
 * it may add to. The gathering is {@link Gathered}, which producers keep to themselves.
 *
 * <p><b>Whether the classification came out is said by whoever knows, and never read off the
 * reason.</b> A clause read far enough to be a bound on a number has its questions worked out and
 * its line unanswered, and a reason saying the reading stopped is true of it. Where a rule's
 * classification did not come out, what says so is the reading that classifies — which for a
 * declaration's clauses is {@code check.Required}, and for a body's comparison is that there is no
 * such reading at all.
 *
 * @param reported     what a report says about a rule that came to no line where it was filed, from
 *                     whichever of the two things happened to the reading. A rule the reading did
 *                     not finish is here as well wherever a reader is owed the sentence about it,
 *                     which is what the finding is for; what it leaves a measure is the question
 *                     beside it. Named for the surface and not for the reading, because it is one
 *                     list for one reader — what the model states is {@link #modelStatements()},
 *                     asked of the reasons rather than read off this
 * @param unclassified the rules nothing worked out the questions of, each holding the measures it
 *                     leaves open

     * had been short of, and every claim about its cases came back unsettled because a rule went
     * unread.

     * rules on as sets has a reading that stopped, and what it admits is exact all the same: what
     * was not worked out is what one rule leaves on its own, which is not the values coming out
     * wider than the rules leave them. Answered with one of those, a reading would call itself
     * partial over a position it answered exactly.
     *
     * <p><b>Asked of both of the lists, which is why it is asked here.</b> A rule of a declaration
     * whose line nothing could fold leaves a finding and its question is the accounting's; a rule
     * nothing classified at all leaves a question and no finding. A caller reading either list for
     * this finds nothing at a place holding the other kind, and hands the values on as what the
