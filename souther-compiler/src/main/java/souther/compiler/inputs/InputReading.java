/**
 * One behavior's input as it was read: where its positions are, what its rules leave the numbers at
 * them, and the names both were read against.
 *
 * <p><b>One value because the three are one reading.</b> Which position a name stands at is the
 * first's to say and what a number there is measured on is the second's, and a reader that holds
 * both uses them together — a term made against one reading and measured on another passes every
 * question either of them asks about itself. Two behaviors can take a parameter spelled the same
 * way, so the term is under a root the second reading has, and what comes back is the order of a
 * position the reader is not asking about. Handed as three arguments, that pairing is the caller's
 * to keep; handed as this, there is nothing to keep.
 *
 * <p>The names are here for the same reason. What a name means is theirs to say, and the quantities
 * were made against one particular answer to that — so the same positions read under another
 * library, or another set of aliases, are a different reading of the same declarations.
 *
 * <p><b>Made by {@link InputDomain#reading} and by nothing else</b>, which is what makes the parts
 * agree. A constructor a caller could reach would be somewhere to put three values back together,
 * and there would be nothing to say they came from one reading — which is the state this exists to
 * remove rather than to check for.
