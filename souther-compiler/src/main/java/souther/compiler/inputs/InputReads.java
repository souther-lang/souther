/**
 * What a tree's names stand for, in terms of a behavior's input, where the reader has got to.
 *
 * <p>A reader meets a position under whatever name is in scope there, and the name is not the
 * position. Three things make that so, and one value carries them.
 *
 * <p>A tree may bind a name the behavior already binds. {@code let order = withDefaults(order)}
 * leaves every read below it naming the local, whose values are whatever the call answers with — so
 * a reader matching the word says about the parameter's rules what is true of nothing.
 *
 * <p>And a body reaches a position through the names bound on the way to it. A helper expanded into
 * a body binds the call's argument to the helper's own parameter and matches that, so a reader that
 * followed no binding would find every statement inside an expanded helper about a position it
 * cannot name — which is most of what a model's rules are written in.
 *
 * <p>And the parameters themselves are bound more than once. An implementation binds them where its
 * body reads them; the declaration binds them where its own {@code ensures} clauses do. Which
 * position a name points at is the same question in either tree, and which bindings ask it is not —
 * so the roots belong to the reading rather than to the input, and a reading given the other one's
 * finds every comparison about nothing.
 *
 * <p>And a name stands for more than a position or nothing. It is a position, or the expression it
 * was given, or one of several values this can write out, or an element an operation handed out, or
 * something this knows nothing about ({@link ReadMeaning}). Answered as a position and nothing, the
 * last four were one answer, and a rule written over a name given arithmetic over positions was read
 * as no rule at all.
 *
 * <p><b>Nothing here decides what a position holds.</b> That is {@link InputDomain}, and it is not
 * reachable from this: what a {@code Core.Read} met in a tree stands for and what the model says
 * about the location it stands at are two questions, asked of two values, meeting only where a
 * reader puts one answer to the other.
 *
 * <p>Which is a difference in how long each of them lives, and not only in what each of them is
 * about. What is here is a function of the program point — the bindings gone under, the arm gone
 * into — and changes at every step of a walk. The reading is one value for a whole analysis. Held
 * in here it would be copied at every step, and a reader would ask whichever copy it had in hand.
 *
 * <p><b>What is known of the names is held and not published.</b> The environment answers the
 * questions a walk asks of it ({@link BindingEnvironment}), and which of its facts wins where a
 * binding is more than one of them is settled inside it — so a caller that reached the tables could
 * settle it again, in an order of its own, which is the whole of what that type is for. Nothing here
 * hands them out, and what a name comes to is asked rather than assembled.
 *
 * <p>What an arm narrowed is this reading's own and not the environment's. It is a fact about where
 * a walk is in the tree rather than about where a binding came from — read under one arm and not
 * under the next — so it is held beside the environment and put to it here.
