/**

 * <p>The one reading of what a declaration states. What a position divides into, what a witness of
 * a type varies over, and what values stand for one of its cases were three readings of one
 * declaration, and they disagreed about how far to look through a name.
 *
 * <p>Through the names, because a newtype is the value it wraps (spec §primitives): a
 * {@code data StageN = Stage} is the sum {@code Stage} and divides into its cases. The names come
 * off to say what the position is and go back on to say what stands at it — one fact, read from
 * {@link TypeView} once, rather than each reader deciding again how far to look.
 *
 * <p><b>An empty answer here is this reading finding nothing stated, and never the position having
 * no distinctions.</b> The two read the same and are not the same claim: the second is a statement
 * about the model, and it is not one this is in a position to make — the rules a body writes have
 * not been read, and what is under the position has not been asked. Which of the two it is travels
 * with the answer ({@link ReadingResult}).
