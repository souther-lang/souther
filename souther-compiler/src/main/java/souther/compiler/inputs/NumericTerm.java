/**
 * The number a rule compares, and where that number is read from.
 *
 * <p>Not the position. A boundary is drawn on a number, and the number a rule names is sometimes the
 * content of a location and sometimes something taken of it — the length of a string, the size of a
 * container, which hour of its day a time falls in. The two were one thing here, so a position holding
 * a string was a position holding no number, and every rule written about its length came back as a
 * rule the model had not written. The discharge procedure has always kept them apart (spec
 * §invariant-discharge-terms); this is the same separation on the side that measures.
 *
 * <p><b>Two variants under one capability.</b> Both of the terms there are today are answered by a
 * single position of the input, and that is what {@link FromOnePosition} says — the capability a
 * reader needs before it may draw a line, classify what stands somewhere, or ask a search to write a
 * value. Whether such a number is what a location holds or what an operation answered of it is a
 * fact about the shape of the term. Which operation,
 * and therefore what its answer is measured by, where it runs, how it is read off a row and what
 * values answer a given number, are facts about the operation and are declared where those are
 * ({@code semantics.OperationFacts}). A variant per operation would put each of those answers back
 * inside the kind of term, which is what {@code SizeOf} was: a size is never negative was written
 * here, and the same proposition about {@code Int.abs} — declared in {@code semantics} — could not
 * be reached from a term at all (#1016, #1027).
 *
 * <p>So nothing below asks which operation it is holding. Every question a reader asks of a term is
 * either answered from the variant, where the variant is genuinely what settles it, or handed to the
 * operation. An operation added to the language is read by everything here without a line being
 * written for it.
