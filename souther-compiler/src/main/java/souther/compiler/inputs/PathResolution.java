/**
 * What a reading of where an expression stands came to.
 *
 * <p>A position reached is one. An expression that names none — arithmetic over a value, a branch
 * between two, something built — is the model saying there is nothing there, and a reader is told
 * so.
 *
 * <p><b>And a place this compiler could not choose between, which is neither of those.</b> A block
 * handed to two walks reads its element at one position on one run and another on the next, so the
 * expression names positions of the input and which of them is not settled. Held as no position, a
 * rule an author wrote about their input leaves the measurement without a word; held as one of them,
 * it is filed where the model may say nothing.
 *
 * <p>None of the three stands for a shape the reading declined. That was an answer here once,
 * because a walk refused shapes for being shapes and a reader could not tell "this expression names
 * no position" from "this walk did not follow that". The walk now refuses a step for what a binding
 * is, and a binding that is nothing this can place is a fact about the model as much as arithmetic
 * over one is — so the ways such an answer could come back are shut where it would come from rather
 * than named here. Every shape a walk after a position meets is answered by an arm of its own, and a
 * shape added to {@link souther.compiler.core.Core} is one that walk does not compile without saying
 * what it names.
 *
 * <p><b>Read out arm by arm by a reader that needs a place, and never by one taking a step.</b>
 * Which position a line is drawn on, which position a claim is about, which position a run is over:
 * each of those needs one place and says so where it asks, and an answer added here does not compile
 * until it has. A reader whose question is where a value stands rather than which place it is has
 * nothing to decide, and asking it to decide is what quietly stops it deciding: such a walk is
 * written as one arm and a catch-all, and a catch-all is exhaustive whatever this gains. That step
 * is taken here ({@link #deeper}) so there is nothing for a catch-all to swallow.
