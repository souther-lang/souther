/**
 * What the parts of a rule left a question standing on.

 * <p><b>And no order.</b> Reasons stand in the order their author wrote the things they are about,
 * and saying which that is needs the source: what is here is which construct each of them is about
 * ({@link RuleSite}), counted over what the author wrote and holding no place at all. A carrier
 * that claimed an order would be claiming one over numbers nobody wrote — the ordinals a construct
 * is identified by are a function of the owner's syntax and are deliberately not the order it is
 * written in ({@code SourceConstructOrigin}) — so the claim is made where the places are, which is
 * the one boundary that has them ({@code AdequacyReport}).
 *
 * <p>It used to be made here, out of the positions each reason stood on. That is what put a place
 * inside every answer a reading published, and what made an edit moving a declaration an edit that
 * changed what the model says.
 *
 * <p>Held in a steady order all the same, and that order is asserted of nothing: it is what keeps
 * one compiler over one source publishing one document. Held in the order a walk met them, the same
 * compiler over the same source would publish two, and which one an author saw would be the run
 * they happened to make.
 *
 * <p>So what is held is {@link Said} and not a word. Two reasons alike about two things inside one
 * rule are two things to lift, and a list of words says they are one.
