/**
 * What a binding is, by where it came from: the one ordering of the facts a name is answered from.
 *
 * <p>A binding can answer to more than one of these at once. A closure parameter of a walk that was
 * joined to the walk before it is what an operation handed an element on, and the join also binds it
 * to what the earlier closure made — so a reader that asked the facts in an order of its own would
 * be deciding, for itself, whether the name is the element it was handed or the value the rewrite
 * left under it. Two readers that decided differently are two accounts of what one name means, and
 * the one that answered second would be about values the first never reached.
 *
 * <p><b>So the order is here and is not a race between roads.</b> A parameter is its position; then
 * a name an operation handed an element on is that element, whatever reading it comes to; then a
 * name is what it was bound to. Each is asked only where the ones before it said nothing, and the
 * one that answers is the answer — not a candidate to be dropped for a longer road found later.
 *
 * <p>Facts about where the binding came from and not what a reader may do with them. Whether the
 * value under an alias may stand where the name stands, and whether an element's container is a
 * position, are questions asked of these rather than settled here ({@link ReadMeaning},
 * {@link InputPath}).
 *
 * <p>What an arm narrowed is not one of these. A {@code match} arm leaves a name standing for some
 * of the values its container was written with, and that is a fact about where a walk is in the tree
 * rather than about where the binding came from — read under one arm and not under the next, where
 * every fact here is as true at one read of the name as at another. Held among these, it would be
 * carried by an ordering that says nothing about it.
