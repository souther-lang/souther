/**
 * The one reading of a position, and what it came to.
 *
 * <p>Package-private, so that {@link Position} is an answer and not a shape anything can fill in.
 * A public record is a constructor anything can call, and an artifact whose point is that it was
 * made once cannot be one.
 *
 * <p>The fields are what the reading saw on the way; {@link #reading} and {@link #obligations} are
 * what follows from them. Held together because they are one reading: copied apart, the day
 * somebody works out {@link #numericDomain} differently for a position that has distinctions is a
 * day the compiler contradicts itself about where the same values stop.
 *
 * @param declared what the position's type states before any rule was crossed with it, kept so that
 *                 a widening can hand it back and so that a distinction this position does not have
 *                 can be told from one the rules refused
