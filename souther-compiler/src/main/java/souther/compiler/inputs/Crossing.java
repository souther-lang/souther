/**
 * What the rules reaching a position leave of the distinctions its type states.
 *
 * <p>Two facts crossed, and they are separate facts. That a type states a distinction is read off
 * the declaration; that a value of it can stand at <em>this</em> position is what the rules on the
 * position leave. A {@code data StageI = Stage invariant value >= Qualified} states three cases and
 * holds two of them: {@code StageI(Prospecting)} is refused at construction (E1903) by the same
 * rule, so a row for it is one nobody can write.
 *
 * <p>Against both readings of what the position can hold, since a rule reaches whichever of them
 * has a word for it. {@code value >= Qualified} is an interval and {@code value == Qualified} is a
 * set of values, and the two say the same thing about the same position — read against the
 * intervals alone, the first took two cases away and the second left all three, so which cases a
 * report asked for turned on how the author spelled one rule.
 *
 * <p><b>Sound whether or not the reading ran to the end of the rules.</b> What the rules leave is an
 * upper bound in either case, so a distinction they leave nothing is one this position cannot hold.
 * What the completeness beside it decides is what may be said about the ones that are left, which is
 * carried out of here rather than acted on: an admission needs every rule read, and a refusal does
 * not.
