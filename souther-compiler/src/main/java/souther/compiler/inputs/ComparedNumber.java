/**
 * One binary of a body, said as the number it is about and what its operator places on that number.
 *
 * <p>The one reading of a comparison. Which number is compared, which side of it the comparison
 * keeps, and where the other side falls on that number's order are one answer and not three — a
 * reader that worked out any of them for itself would be reading the comparison a second time, and
 * two readings of one comparison are two answers as soon as they are asked under different bindings.
 *
 * <p><b>The place is on the number's order, and never on the position's.</b>
 * {@code Time.minute(slot.at) >= 30} names thirty on the order minutes are counted on; what stands
 * at {@code slot.at} is a time, and half past midnight is what that thirty would be there. The two
 * coincide only where the number is what the position holds.
 *
 * @param term   the number the comparison is about. A number over a run of values is one of these
 *               too: it is what the comparison is about, and it is answered by no single position
 * @param orders the order the number is written on and the one it is counted on, or null where
 *               nothing puts an order under it
 * @param placed what the comparison says of the values either side of {@link #at}, turned round
 *               where the number was written on the right. The wide classification, because what
 *               reaches this reading is any binary a walk met: an arithmetic operator names numbers
 *               too and places nothing on them
 * @param at     where the other side falls on the number's order, or null where it is not a value
 *               that order writes — another position, a value this compiler does not place
