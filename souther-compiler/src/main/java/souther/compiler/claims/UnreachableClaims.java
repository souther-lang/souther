/**
 * What a behavior's body declares cannot arrive.
 *
 * <p>Claims and nothing else. Reaching an {@code unreachable} is E1911, so a case behind one is a
 * case an author is being told not to write a row at — and what settles whether they should be told
 * that is the model's own rules, not the sentence saying so. Read here, judged in {@link Claims}.
 *
 * <p><b>Every claim the body makes about a position of its input, and the arm it makes it at.</b>
 * A {@code match} on an input position, wherever it is written, has an arm per case, and an arm
 * that answers nothing is that case being declared not to arrive. What is read off each is the
 * same; what differs is whether anything arrives there, and that is not decided here — the claim
 * carries the arm and the reading of what arrives answers about it.
 *
 * <p>Names are resolved through what the {@code let}s in scope bound, so a helper expanded into the
 * body is read against the position the call handed it. A function written where a call takes one is
 * entered like anything else: what it matches on is resolved the same way, and a name it binds
 * itself resolves to no position of this input, which is the answer that arm deserves.
 *
 * <p>Nothing is read off a condition: telling which values satisfy {@code somePredicate(f)} is what
 * a solver does. So claims are missed, and that direction is the safe one now that a claim moves no
 * denominator — a claim nothing read is a case the report asks for a row at, and an author reading a
 * gap they cannot fill is at least told something true about their model.
