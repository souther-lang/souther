/**
 * A body saying that one case of one input position cannot arrive.
 *
 * <p>A statement and not a finding. What the model's own rules say about the same case is read
 * elsewhere and the two are put together once ({@link Claims}); until then this is what was
 * written, in the words it was written in.
 *
 * @param at      the position the case belongs to, spelled the way a rule about it is
 * @param named   the case, by the declaration it is
 * @param reasons every reason on the paths that answer nothing, in the order they are evaluated. An
 *                arm made of a {@code match} whose arms abort for different reasons has no single
 *                reason, and taking the one written above the others would name it by where it
 *                happens to sit in the file
 * @param said    where the first of them is written, which is what a diagnostic points at
 * @param where   the arm itself, as the reading of what arrives names it. Not the probe: an arm
 *                answering {@code unreachable} answers no value, so no run can be recorded in it
 *                and it never had one — which is why a claim is judged at the control point
