 * taken as it is — the same terms a line is drawn on, so a column of the table and a border on the
 * same comparison cannot be about different quantities. What a dependency answered is this
 * reading's own, and it is held here rather than added to the input's vocabulary: what a search may
 * assume about the input and what a row may pin a dependency to are different licences, and a type
 * that carried both would hand each reader the other's.
