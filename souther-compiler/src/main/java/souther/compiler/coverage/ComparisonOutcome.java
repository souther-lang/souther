/**
 * One comparison coming out one way, as a run records it.
 *
 * <p>Recorded from the comparison's own value and never worked out from the arm that follows it. A
 * condition stops as soon as it is settled, so under {@code A && B} the arm taken when the condition
 * fails is reached both by a value that made {@code B} false and by one that never evaluated
 * {@code B} — the arm cannot say which, and a reading that recovered the way out of it would be
 * guessing at exactly the point a claim about the comparison is made.
 *
 * <p>Three states and not two, which is what having these at all buys. A comparison can have come
 * out one way, come out the other, or not have been reached: the first two are one of these being
 * recorded and the third is neither of them being, and nothing else in a run's record can tell the
 * third from the other two.
 *
 * <p>Written in the emitter's vocabulary, which is the one a run is recorded in. What a probed class
 * calls is {@code Probe.compared} with the number the emitter put in the call, and nothing running
 * has a catalog to say which comparison that is. Which comparison a reading is talking about is
 * {@link ComparisonOccurrence}, and the plan is what turns one into the other.
 *
 * <p><b>The number and not an address.</b> A probed class is handed the number the emitter wrote
 * into the call and has no numbering to ask what it addresses; a recording is what that class left
 * behind, so it is written in numbers. Joining one back to the place it was issued for is the other
 * side of that boundary and belongs there — a recording that carried an address would be carrying
 * an answer nothing running could have given.
 *
 * @param at   the number the run was recorded at
 * @param held the way it came out
