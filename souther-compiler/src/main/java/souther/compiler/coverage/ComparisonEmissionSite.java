/**
 * Where a run through one comparison is recorded: a number, and the numbering that handed it out.
 *
 * <p>An address and not an identity. What a probed class calls is {@code Probe.compared} with an
 * {@code int}, and what comes back from a recording is that {@code int} — so the number is the
 * vocabulary a run is written and read in, and it reaches no further. Which comparison a reading is
 * talking about is {@link ComparisonOccurrence}, and the two are held apart because they are
 * answered by different things: the plan hands out an address for the comparisons it instruments,
 * and the catalog names every comparison the bodies hold whether anything instruments it or not.
 *
 * <p>Kept as one value rather than as the {@code int} it wraps, so that an address cannot be handed
 * where an identity is wanted. Under one type the two were the same number, and a reading that
 * asked which comparison it was looking at got an answer that was true only while every comparison
 * the catalog held was one the emitter had numbered.
 *
 * <p><b>What it carries is the numbering, and the numbering is a value.</b> Two derivations of one
 * module come to the same numbering, so two addresses of it are the same address — which is what
 * lets one of these be held under an answer a store keeps and compared with what a recomputation
 * makes of it.
 *
 * <p><b>Made by the numbering and by nothing else.</b> {@link SiteNumbering#comparison} is the only
 * maker, and it refuses a number that numbering never issued and one it issued to an arm.
