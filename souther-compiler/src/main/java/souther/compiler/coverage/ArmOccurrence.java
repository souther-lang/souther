/**
 * One arm of one fork, in the tree that runs: which fork, and which of its arms.
 *
 * <p>What tells one decision from another where all a reader can say is that a fork was settled. A
 * reading that cannot name the position a fork is about still knows that going one way and going
 * the other are the same decision settled twice, and this is what says which decision that is.
 *
 * <p><b>The fork as the tree has it, and not as a walk counted it.</b> A non-recursive helper is
 * spliced into each body that calls it and an operation applies the block it was handed as often as
 * it likes, so one fork the author wrote is several in the tree that runs — each reached under its
 * own conditions, and each settled on a value of its own. Which of them this is is
 * {@link ConstructOccurrence}, which the fork node carries; a number handed out by whatever walked
 * the bodies would be an identity two readers can derive differently, and the readers below joining
 * on it would be joining on the walk.
 *
 * <p><b>And not where a run through it is recorded.</b> That is {@link ArmProbe}, an address the
 * emitter issues for what it instruments — an arm answering {@code unreachable} has none, and is
 * still an arm a reading can prove nothing arrives at. An identity and an address held as one value
 * would leave such an arm nameless.
 *
 * @param fork which fork of the tree that runs
 * @param part which of that fork's arms, by where the arm stands in the fork: the arms of an
 *             {@code if}, the cases of a {@code match} and the ways an attempted construction comes
 *             out are each written in an order the node itself has. What emits them walks that
 *             order and does not decide it, so an emitter that emitted them in some other order
 *             would be emitting these same arms
