/**
 * Something a run can be held to: that it passed one place, coming out one way.
 *
 * <p>The one thing a reading of the model may assert about a run, and the only shape a certification
 * has to know. A claim is a place and nothing about why anyone is interested in it — which is what
 * keeps whatever is doing the reading and whatever records the running from growing into each other.
 * The reading's own vocabulary changes as the reading gets better; that a comparison came out false
 * does not.
 *
 * <p>Not every place is one of these. An arm no row that stands can be in carries no probe, so a run
 * through it is not something any recording could hold — and a claim on it would be one nothing could
 * ever satisfy, which is worse than no claim at all: it reads as a combination that was tried and
 * missed. {@link #of} is where that is decided, so a claim that exists is one an observation can
 * answer.
