/**
 * The arms of a behavior's body that an {@code example} row can be in or not in.
 *
 * <p>What this counts is <em>branch-arm coverage</em>, and calling it anything larger would overstate
 * it. Passing through all four arms of
 *
 * <pre>if A { if B { X } else { Y } } else { Z }</pre>
 *
 * does not mean the interactions between A and B were tried, nor that every reachable path was. Branch
 * coverage is a lower bound on covering the paths a body has, not the same thing, and a report that
 * says "code paths" invites the author to stop looking.
 *
 * <p>An arm that answers nothing gets no site. Reaching one is already an error ({@code E1911}), so a
 * probe there would leave every correct model permanently one arm short and make the denominator lie.
 * Which arms those are is {@link NormalReturn}'s answer, so an arm whose every path ends in an
 * {@code unreachable} is as much not an arm as one written as a bare {@code unreachable}. An
 * invariant clause gets none either: it is a property of a type, not a fork in this body, and whether
 * the rows reach its edges is a different measure asked another way.
 *
 * <p>A {@code guard … else} and a comprehension's condition are both an {@code if} by the time they
 * get here, so the walk has one case for the three of them — and what they are is not read off that
 * case. Which construct the author wrote is carried from where the source was read
 * ({@link souther.compiler.types.CoverageConstruct}), and what one way through it means is a
 * {@link SourceOutcome} beside it. Deciding either from the shape of the lowered node is answering a
 * question about the source out of the tree that runs, which is how a comprehension came to be
 * reported as a {@code guard} with a {@code then} arm.
 *
 * <p>Helper bodies are not walked: a non-recursive helper is already inlined into the body that uses it,
 * and a recursive one is a shared method rather than a fork in any one behavior.
