/**
 * A place in a body that something can or cannot arrive at, named once.
 *
 * <p>Not the probe number. A probe is made where a row can be recorded, which takes two things:
 * the place has to answer a value, and it has to stand where a row can get to. So the arms an
 * author writes and the arms a run can be observed in are different collections, and the ones with
 * no probe are exactly the ones a claim is about — an arm answering {@code unreachable} answers no
 * value, so it never had a number, and the reading that judges what the author declared there was
 * looking for it under one.
 *
 * <p>Two layers, made together and here only. Everything below reads whichever it needs: a claim is
 * judged at the {@code controlId}, a branch denominator counts the arms that carry a probe, and a
 * line drawn on a comparison asks about the outcome that leads into an arm rather than about the
 * arm. Derived apart, each of them would answer for a different collection of places, which is what
 * a measurement number standing in for an identity already did once.
 *
 * <p>Numbered per plan, in the order the walk makes them. Two calls of one helper are two
 * occurrences and two ids: each is reached under its caller's own conditions, so what can arrive at
 * one says nothing about the other. What they share is the obligation ({@link
 * CoverageSites.Obligation}), which is what a row is owed for and is not this.
