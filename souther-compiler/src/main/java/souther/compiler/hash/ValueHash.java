/**
 * How a value is hashed from what it holds.
 *
 * <p>A value whose hash is worked out from its parts is nearly always handed to something that adds
 * hashes up: a set of them sums what it holds, a map sums its entries, and a record built over one
 * carries its last component into its own hash unchanged. So a hash that is an affine function of
 * its parts — a sum of them, or a sum with each part multiplied by something — is a hash whose
 * parts are still separable once it arrives there, and the sum above cancels what the value was
 * built to state. Two pairs over four blocks come to one number whenever the same four blocks are
 * paired the other way round; two lacks over four blocks come to one number whenever the same
 * blocks are shared out between them differently. What is lost in each is the pairing, which is the
 * one thing those values exist to say.
 *
 * <p><b>So the parts are gathered and then finished, once, at the boundary of the value that owns
 * them.</b> Finishing is not distributive over the sum above it, which is what stops the two levels
 * cancelling. Where the finishing is matters as much as that it happens: finishing a whole set of
 * lacks after the sum has already been taken finishes a number the pairing has already left, and
 * recovers nothing. Every value gathers its own parts and finishes its own number, and hands the
 * finished one up.
 *
 * <p><b>What a caller names here is the shape of the value's equality, not a mixing step.</b> A
 * roled pair and an unordered pair are hashed differently because they are equal differently, and a
 * caller that reached for a mixing function would still have to decide how to gather two parts
 * symmetrically — which is the decision that went wrong. So there is no mixing step to call: each
 * of these takes the parts and answers the whole number, and a value's hash is one call to one of
 * them. Which one is the same question as which equality the value has, and is readable beside it.
 *
 * <p>The kind is taken in because two values of different kinds holding alike are two values, and
 * where both are cases of one sum type nothing else here tells them apart — a block stated apart
 * from itself and a block left no value name the same block and claim different things.
 *
 * <p><b>How many parts a value has is not asked here.</b> There are as many of these as there are
 * values to write, and a value of five parts is a fifth one written when there is one. What
 * they are for is the shape of an equality, and the shapes are what the shapes are.
 *
 * <p><b>A package holding this and nothing else, which the packages of values depend on.</b> Where
 * a value is written says nothing about how it is hashed: a relation between positions and the
 * identity of a binding are both handed to something that adds hashes up, and the sum above
 * cancels an affine number either way. A discipline one package keeps and the next does not is two
 * answers to one question, and the second of them is the one carrying the defect.
 *
 * <p>Which is what the members being public says, and the whole of it. Crossing a package boundary
 * in Java is what the word is for here; nothing outside this compiler is offered a hash of a value
 * of its own.
