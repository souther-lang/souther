/**
 * What a behavior has written in its {@code ensures}, in the author's own words.
 *
 * <p>Cut out of the source and not printed from what the clause was read to mean. The two are
 * different things and only one of them is what a reader is owed here: a clause the author wrote is
 * text, and a rule the checker holds is that text resolved, typed and specialized per case
 * ({@link souther.compiler.check.BehaviorContract}). Rendering the second would hand back the
 * compiler's equivalent words for the author's, and the day a normalization changed one of them the
 * quote would move without anybody editing anything.
 *
 * <p>Read off the settled module and not off the contracts, which is the same decision seen from the
 * other side. A contract is a clause the checker could read: {@link Bodies.Contracts} takes each
 * behavior's reading on its own and drops the ones that were refused, so a behavior carrying a clause
 * this compiler would not accept has no entry there. {@code souther examples} says what is wrong with
 * the source and then reports what it observed, so that behavior's rows are offered anyway — a
 * behavior whose arm names a data that is no case of its answer is refused and still gets a row per
 * case of a sum it takes. A quote taken from the contracts would print nothing over those rows, which
 * reads as a behavior that states nothing rather than one whose statement was refused. The words are
 * on the page either way, and that is the whole of what the heading claims.
