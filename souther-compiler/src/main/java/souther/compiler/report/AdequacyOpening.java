/**
 * One thing keeping an adequacy verdict undetermined.
 *
 * <p>Not a {@link Weakening}, and that is the whole of why this type exists. A verdict is settled
 * by everything it rests on having come to an answer, and only one of the ways that fails is a
 * measure going without something. A measure that could have found a gap and was never made weakens
 * nothing — {@link souther.compiler.query.Measurement.NotMeasured} carries no {@code WeakeningSet}
 * on purpose, which is what separates it from a measurement that was asked for and could not be
 * finished. Neither does a point the rows are read out at where nothing could show a row can be
 * written: whether one can be is a second question, settled from what showed it and not from the
 * coverage. So a list of weakenings said nothing at all about a model nobody has written rows for,
 * or about a point nothing promised, while the verdict over each stayed open.
 *
 * <p>Read off the verdict's own predicate rather than assembled beside it. Every arm below is what
 * one of the things {@code adequacy()} walks contributes, so {@code undetermined} and this being
 * empty cannot both be true — which is a property worth having and is the one the conformance
 * corpus produced a counterexample to.
 *
 * <p><b>What it is not.</b> Not everything that left the report weaker than it looks: a measure
 * this build is not held to may be as partial as it likes without a bar being any less settled by
 * it. And not a second vocabulary — each arm is projected to a word the document already has.
