/**
 * Where one thing this report says leaves the person reading it.
 *
 * <p>Beside {@link Subject} and not derived from it. A subject says what an entry is about; this
 * says how far the compiler can take a reader from there, and one subject reaches more than one
 * answer — a behavior is named by a measure nobody made, by a boundary nothing could be worked out
 * for, and by a space too large to walk, and a wider run reaches the last of those and neither of
 * the others. So this is read from the whole of what an entry says.
 *
 * <p><b>What it is not is a remediation.</b> An arm names an operation this compiler knows is
 * appropriate, or a decision only a person can make and the place to make it at. It never names a
 * change to the model as necessary: whether five cases at a position are more than a behavior needs
 * is a judgement, and a compiler that answered it would be spending evidence it does not have. What
 * follows from {@link ReconsiderWhatThisBehaviorNeedsToDistinguish} may be narrowing the input,
 * splitting the behavior, or leaving it exactly as it is, and all three are right answers to
 * different models.
 *
 * <p><b>Nothing publishes this.</b> A consumer keyed on it would be keyed on a vocabulary of
 * guidance, which is what both of the issues behind it declined to put in the document. What it is
 * for is that the sentences this report writes about an entry follow from what the compiler worked
 * out rather than from what a formatter guessed, and that every entry has one — which a
 * {@code switch} with no {@code default} is what holds.
