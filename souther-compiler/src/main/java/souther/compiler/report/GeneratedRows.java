 * the language writes for a row whose answer is owed: the row parses, the module goes on compiling,
 * and the checker reports the answer as work the author has left. So a block can be pasted whole and
 * answered a row at a time, and what was pasted is source — {@code souther fmt} runs over it, a
 * rename of a field a row names reaches it, and the report keeps saying which rows are still owed
 * an answer.
 *
 * <p>What is commented is the prose. A block carries lines that are not Souther — the {@code ensures}
 * a behavior states, a note over a row composed for more than one thing, a line for each point no row
 * could be written at — and those are written as comments so that the block around them stays
 * something a file can hold.
 *
 * <p>Nothing is written to a file. Where the rows belong is a question with a real answer — the
 * module's own source or an attached {@code examples for} file — and one this does not have to guess
 * at, because a person who can read the block can put it where they want it.
