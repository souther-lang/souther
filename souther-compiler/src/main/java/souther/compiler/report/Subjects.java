/**
 * What each thing a report can be about is about, projected to the one vocabulary a reader is sent
 * in.
 *
 * <p>A {@code switch} per sum and no {@code default} anywhere. Every arm this file reads is a sum
 * whose members carry the identity, and twice now an arm was added to one of them while whoever
 * read it kept naming the outer shape — a row that did not come back was answered as its behavior,
 * and a position the reading never reached into was answered as a rule. Both are the same mistake,
 * and it is one javac can make instead: an arm added to any sum below stops this compiling, and
 * whoever adds it has to say what a reader is sent to for it.
 *
 * <p>What is not here is the two subjects no payload holds. A measurement nobody made and an
 * obligation's disposition carry what they went without and nothing about which measure or which
 * point they are of, so those subjects are the walk's to hand in ({@link Subject}).

     * else, and that is the fact's own identity rather than a shortage: what a measure of that
     * behavior went without is one thing however many measures noticed it, and a subject naming the
     * measure would make it as many facts as the behavior has measures.
     *
     * <p>What is not the subject is what happened. A border read in two ways is one line and two
     * reasons; a position the walk did not reach into is one place and one of five stops. Those
     * travel beside the subject, so the entries stay two and the reader is sent to one place.
