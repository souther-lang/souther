/**
 * What a reason reads as to a person.
 *
 * <p>An {@link Incompleteness} is data rather than a sentence, which is what lets a build count and
 * match on it. Two things print one for a reader — the report, and the note beside the rows
 * {@code --generate} writes — and both printed the enum's own name for a while. That told an author
 * with a type error in front of them that their runtime was missing, the code having been named
 * after one of the things it covers.
 *
 * <p>One wording, written once. Two renderers of the same fact drift, and the two here are read
 * side by side in the same terminal.
 *
 * <p><b>The rule this is held to.</b> A sentence here is keyed on the code and nothing else, so it
 * may say only what is true at <em>every</em> place that writes that code. The code is not what
 * happened; the producer is, and two producers writing one code mean two different things by it.
 * Where a consequence holds at one producer and not another, it belongs to the producer and cannot
 * be recovered from the code — the value would have to carry it. Nothing here may reach for it.
 *
 * <p>That rule is the whole of what this class gets wrong when it gets something wrong, and it has
 * already done so twice: once by writing a sentence for every code without reading any producer,
 * and once by giving a linkage failure the consequence its first producer has and its other two do
 * not.

    /**
     * What happened, said as what happened — and no further than every producer agrees.
     *
     * <p>Each has been read against its own. {@code ROW_UNDECIDED} has one producer;
     * {@code OBSERVATION_ABSENT} has two and they mean the same thing; {@code INSTRUMENTATION_ABSENT}
     * has one, on a branch taken only where arm coverage was asked for and returning no rows, so
     * the sentence may name the request and the empty result both.
     *
     * <p>{@code LINKAGE_FAILED} has one now and had three. The other two were a fill and a boundary
     * that could not build a candidate, and both were things the generator did rather than things a
     * measurement could not read; they say so in the generator's own vocabulary now. What is left
     * is an example whose evaluation raised one, where nothing was observed — so the sentence may
     * say the rows did not run, which it could not while three producers disagreed about it.
     *
     * <p>The rest keep the shape they had, which asserts nothing the code does not already say.
     * The two value codes have been read as well. {@code VALUE_TRUNCATED} has one producer;
     * {@code VALUE_UNREADABLE} has five — a parameter that is not there, a field chain that leads
     * nowhere, a value the observer could not read, a value in none of the classes, and a position
     * some row could not be placed at — which agree that the value could not be read and say
     * nothing about why, so that is where the sentence stops. The two are apart because what an
     * author does about them is: one goes away if the fixture is written smaller and the other
     * does not.
     *
     * <p>Every code has one now, which is what it means for this enum to be the vocabulary a report
     * is written in. What the generator has to say about its own run is said in its own words, by
     * the block that prints it: a position it left out and a search that ended are things it did,
     * not things a measurement could not read.
