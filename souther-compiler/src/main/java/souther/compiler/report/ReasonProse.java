/**
 * What a person is told about a measure that has no number.
 *
 * <p>The whole of the report's vocabulary for a reason, in one place, which is where every other
 * surface a reason reaches already spells it: the document writes {@code reason.name()} lowercased,
 * and the fact one reaches an author with is chosen inside the reason's own {@code switch}. Written
 * instead where each line is printed, a vocabulary gives a reason arriving at a line nobody wrote a
 * word for the word of whichever arm its type happens to match.
 *
 * <p><b>The state and not its type.</b> A reason is a constant and a reason type may hold more than
 * one, so an arm binding the type covers every constant that type will ever have — and a behavior
 * measured short of either half of its boundary is told its signature could not be read, when for
 * one of the two the signature is in hand. Every enum here is read through to its constants by a
 * {@code switch} expression with no {@code default}, whether it has two constants today or one:
 * what closes this is that adding a constant stops the compiler, and an enum spelled as one arm
 * today is the enum a second constant is added to tomorrow.
 *
 * <p><b>Which of the three families a reason is in decides how the sentence opens.</b> {@code not
 * applicable} asks nothing of an author and {@code not measured} says what to do
 * (spec §example-report-vocabulary), and that is what {@link NotApplicableReason} and the two
 * beside it are. Chosen at each line instead, the opening is a second reading of the reason, held
 * to the family by whoever writes the line.
 *
 * <p>Each family is asked in its own {@code switch} over a sealed interface, so a reason type added
 * to one of them stops the compiler here as well. What is left open is {@link MeasureReason}
 * itself: a type reaching it without passing through one of the three has no sentence, and there is
 * nothing below to ask for one.
 *
 * <p><b>Words, and nothing about where they are said.</b> Whether a reason is a fact about the run
 * or about the behavior decides whether a surface gives it a line of its own, and it is the
 * reason's answer ({@link MeasureReason#about()}) rather than a second column here. Held beside the
 * words, one fact about a constant was written down in as many tables as there are readers, and the
 * fold over the readings of one line — which needs the same fact to tell two readings saying one
 * thing from two readings saying two — had no table to read and worked from a different question.
 *
 * @param introduction how the sentence opens, which the family settles
 * @param said         what this state says
