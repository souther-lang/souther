/**
 * The Core IR (ADR-0021): a checked executable expression, which is what every backend emits from.
 *
 * <p>Three things the language states reach a backend as this — a behavior's or a {@code let}'s
 * body, a data's {@code invariant} condition, and the rule an {@code ensures} states — and each is
 * the written expression with the helpers it names inlined and the surface-only forms desugared. It
 * differs from the AST in what it makes explicit: a construct the backend used to re-detect and
 * shape during emission becomes its own node here, so the backend only emits.
 *
 * <p>Every node carries {@link #type()}: the type the checker decided for it (issue #81). The
 * checker is the only producer of Core — it builds the tree as it types what was written
 * ({@code Elaborator.elaborate}) — so the backend reads those decisions instead of deciding them a
 * second time. A condition was the exception until #1080, and being the exception meant the last
 * step of deciding what a clause meant sat inside a backend.
 *
 * <p>A name in a body is one of two nodes, not one: a read of something the body binds, and a unit
 * data written as its own value. They were one, and the emitter told them apart by looking the
 * spelling up in its slots and falling back when it found nothing — which is an answer about a
 * name, decided by its text.
 *
 * <p>A surface-only node (a list comprehension) never appears — it is desugared before the
 * elaboration that produces this, whether what is being read is a body or a clause.
