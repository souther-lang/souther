/**
 * A module this compiler restored from an artifact and then checked: everything an importer needs to
 * build against it, and nothing that was still being worked out.
 *
 * <p>Holding one is holding a module whose import lines have been read. There is no value for a
 * module that was decoded and not checked, and none for a module that was never read at all — the
 * only implementation is {@link ModuleReadback}'s, and only a reading that answered
 * {@link Readback.Ready} builds one. So the reader that took the module and left the table behind
 * cannot be written, which is what it did, leaving an invariant's bare names resolving against
 * nothing in every project but the one that wrote it.
 *
 * <p>Sealed rather than a record, because a record is a constructor. Read anywhere, built in one
 * place: outside {@code souther.compiler.meta} nothing can make one at all, and inside it the one
 * implementation is the readback's own.
 *
 * <p>The three are one fact and travel together. The module no longer says what its bare names mean
 * — the lines that said so are dropped once read — so {@link #libraryClaims()} is the only thing that
 * does. Where a behavior's body comes from is not written in any declaration and does not survive as
 * source, so it cannot be worked out again from the module either.
 *
 * <p>Told apart from {@link PublishedUniverse.Read}, which is a stage further on: that one holds a
 * module every name of which has been answered, against a universe of other modules. This is what
 * one artifact gives before any of that is asked.
