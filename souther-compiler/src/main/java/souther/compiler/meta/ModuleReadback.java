/**
 * Reading a module back from what {@link ModuleMetadata} wrote into its classes: the declarations
 * another project needs in order to {@code import} it, without its {@code .sou}.
 *
 * <p>The declarations are put back together as one source and handed to the parser, so what an
 * importing project sees is what the declaring project wrote, read by the same front end. What comes
 * back of the module's implementation is what its declarations cannot be read without: the helpers
 * an invariant calls, and the {@code let}s it publishes, which a reader substitutes and expands for
 * itself. Every other body stays where it was written.
 *
 * <p>Travelling as source is also what a published body's meaning rests on. A helper is read back by
 * the same rule that read it in the first place, so one whose parameter types its body settles
 * arrives with no types written and is settled again here — including one that names what a value is
 * and leaves what it holds open, which is why no type variable has to be written for it to cross.
 *
 * <p>Reading the import lines is part of reading the module and not a step after it, and so is
 * indexing what it declares. A module comes out of here with its library names already answered and
 * its declarations already indexed ({@link ReadableModule}), because both can fail and both used to
 * be left to whoever wanted them: a caller that read the module and not the import lines held one
 * whose bare names resolved against nothing in every project but the one that wrote it, and a
 * caller that indexed afterwards had a known failure arriving as a raise from inside a lookup.
 *
 * <p>Nothing here raises for an artifact this compiler will not read. Every such failure is a
 * {@link Readback.Failure}, named where it is found by the code that knows its shape, so what
 * converts is stated rather than decided by how wide a caller's catch happened to be.
 *
 * <p>One raise is turned into a failure here, the parser's, and the catch is around the parse
 * alone. The other physical way a reading fails — bytes this runtime does not read — is answered
 * as a value by {@link PublishedClasses}, which is where the bytes are and so the only place that
 * knows what went wrong with them. Nothing here reads an exception type as a statement about
 * somebody's artifact.
