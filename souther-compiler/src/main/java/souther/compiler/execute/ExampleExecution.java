/**
 * Everything an evaluation of one module's examples reads, as this compile settled it.
 *
 * <p>Not a second model of a module. What an output reads of a checked program is Core, lowered,
 * and an example is not there: a row's inputs and its expected value are expressions the checker
 * read and never lowered, and the definitions a fixture reaches are the ones a call expands rather
 * than the ones the module emits. So this is not the checked program under another name — it is the
 * stage the checked program does not have, and nothing here is a second answer to a question the
 * checked program already answers.
 *
 * <p>It carries and does not decide. Every part of it is some other question's answer, taken whole:
 * what the names mean, what each behavior's shape is, what it needs supplied, what the module
 * defines, and what its behaviors declare of what they answer. Nothing here re-derives one of those
 * from the others — a carrier that started answering would be the second model this is not.
 *
 * <p>What it does hold together is the correlation. The rows and the module they are rows of come
 * from one preparation and cannot be paired wrongly, which is the condition a run of them is
 * correct under; and the terms the rows are held to are this compile's, read once, so two runs of
 * one module are not two budgets.
 *
 * <p>Module-wide, with the source asked for at the question. Which file a row is written in decides
 * which rows a question is about, not what the module means, and a copy of this per source would
 * make "all of them" and "one file's" two states of one type.
