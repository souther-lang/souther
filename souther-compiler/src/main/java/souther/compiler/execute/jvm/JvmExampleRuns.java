/**
 * A run of one module's rows against an implementation supplied from outside Souther.
 *
 * <p>Beside {@link JvmProgramExecution} and not on it. What the language asks is whether its rows
 * hold, and the answer to that is the program this compile emitted; what this is for is a caller
 * that brings its own answerer — a Java object implementing an injected behavior — and wants the
 * module's rows run against it. That is not the same question with a parameter added. It is a
 * binding of Java to Souther, and {@link Answering} says so in its own face: what it hands back is
 * made from a manifest of generated implementations and a loader, which no other implementation of
 * an execution would have.
 *
 * <p>So it is not a second way to ask what acceptance asks. It is reached by the Java-facing
 * {@code SoutherExamples} integration and by nothing that decides whether a program is accepted; a
 * caller that wanted the compile's own answer asks the capability.

     * what the row hands over through, and reaches the worker's hand-off. A caller able to name them
