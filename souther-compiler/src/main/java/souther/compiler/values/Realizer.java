/**
 * What a position's plan comes to, built once and under an allowance.
 *
 * <p>The plan says which values the position admits and says it without an order
 * ({@link AdmittedPlan}); this turns it into the set. What that costs is counted where the states
 * are made ({@link Meter}), and where the allowance runs out what comes back is that it was not
 * built — never a smaller set, which would be this compiler answering a model with something it
 * made up because the truth was expensive.
 *
 * <p><b>The order the work is done in is this one's to choose, and it is chosen from the plan.</b>
 * A meet holding a set the rules wrote out is a meet whose answer is inside that set, so it is
 * settled by asking the written values and never by building anything — {@code [a-z]{300}} met with
 * {@code {"x"}} is a question about one string. Read in the order a clause happened to state it,
 * the same rules met the two patterns first and gave up on a product nobody needed. What is chosen
 * here is fixed by the plan and not by a heuristic that could change: a reader may work out what
 * this will do from what it is given.
 *
 * <p>Answers are kept, so a plan realized twice is realized once. Which is what lets a caller force
 * an answer early — to ask whether the position admits anything at all, say — without the position
 * paying twice for it, and what makes when it was asked not part of what it costs.
