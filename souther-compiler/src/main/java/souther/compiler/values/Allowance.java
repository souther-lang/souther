/**
 * What each block of one answer is allowed to build, and everything that builds under it.
 *
 * <p>Held per block, because a block is what an answer is about: every rule reaching one pays
 * into the machine it finally admits, whether the rules are two halves of a clause, two clauses of
 * one declaration, or two declarations met by whoever needed both. One allowance for the whole
 * reading instead would let a complicated rule at one block spend what a plain one at another was
 * going to need, and which of them went unanswered would turn on the order they were written in.
 *
 * <p><b>A block and not a position, because a machine is made once for one answer.</b> Positions a
 * rule holds as one value have one set between them ({@link Sameness}), so they ask for one machine
 * and it is bought from one purse. Charged to a member instead, which of them paid would be a
 * choice this makes, and the same rules written with the equality the other way round would spend a
 * different number. A position no equality reached is a block of one, which is what every purse
 * was before any of this.
 *
 * <p><b>One answer, one allowance.</b> Turning a rule into the set it names and putting a position's
 * sets together are the same spending, and so is putting two readings' answers together afterwards —
 * what comes out of that is a third set nobody has paid for. An answer given a fresh allowance for
 * each of those may spend its whole budget several times over, and the bound would be on a phase
 * rather than on the answer.
 *
 * <p><b>And nothing composes outside it.</b> Everything that may build is asked for through
 * {@link AdmittedPlan} and worked out by a {@link Realizer}, which is what makes the order the work
 * is done in a function of what is being asked rather than of who asked first. Two sets put together
 * by whoever held them would be a fold in arrival order again, one layer further out.
