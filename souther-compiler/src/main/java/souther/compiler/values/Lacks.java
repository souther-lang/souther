/**
 * What one argument about a relation showed, which is every lack it showed and not one of them.
 *
 * <p>Nothing here is in an order. An argument that walks the sets a count is taken of reaches them
 * in the order the pairs were written, and two writings of one relation are one relation — so what
 * these are equal to is settled by which lacks they are and how each was reached, and by nothing
 * about where in a walk each was found.
 *
 * <p>Each lack once, with every route that reached it. Two readings put together can show one lack
 * by taking a block's values through different rules, and both lots of rules are what an author has
 * to answer for.
 *
 * <p><b>Which is why what is inside is not what is handed out.</b> These are held in the order they
 * arrived, because a lack about several blocks hashes through the set of blocks it names — measured
 * on the shape the walk is admitted at, and on the numbers a lack had then, putting them somewhere
 * that hashes them on the way in was what a reduction cost rather than a part of it. An order
 * nobody may read is not an order a value may show, so nothing here answers with one: a reader asks
 * what was claimed, what a report may name, or whether every lack is of some kind.
 *
 * <p>And what a lack claims is what these are looked up by, which is a question asked of every lack
 * of one of these against every lack of another wherever two are put together. Asked by walking,
 * that is the square of a relation's sets on a relation admitted for as many of them as the bound
 * allows — so which of these claims what is worked out once, when they are made.
 *
 * @param <A> what a position is called
