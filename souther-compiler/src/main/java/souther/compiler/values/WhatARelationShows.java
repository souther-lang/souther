 * Where a proof takes the lacks themselves, whoever handed them over has already decided whether to
 * look for them — and the decision they had to hand was whether some side of the alternative was
 * left nothing, which is the other half of the same proof. A proof built that way names whichever
 * of its two witnesses was asked about first.
 *
 * <p><b>Closed, and not a question anybody may write.</b> A question handed over as a lambda is one
 * its author may write over anything in reach, the blocks of the alternative included — so a type
 * that only promised to ask it would be promising about what its callers happened to write. What
 * may be asked is the two below. Neither maker is given a question about a block or an answer to
 * one, so a relation left unread because a block was refused is not something there is a way to
 * say.
 *
 * <p>Which leaves {@link Refusal#ofAnAlternative} asking this once and always, and the ordering
 * this type exists to rule out unwritable rather than merely unwritten.
