/**
 * What the denials between an alternative's blocks leave nothing of.
 *
 * <p>A claim and not the argument that reached it. Which blocks were read to show a lack, and in
 * what order their values went, is how it was reached; what it says is that these blocks are left
 * nothing. Two readings that reach one claim along different routes have shown one thing, and it is
 * the claim that {@link Refusal#shownByBoth} keeps — a route carried in here would make them two
 * claims and a choice between the readings would be answered as though neither had shown anything.
 * Where a route is wanted, it is {@link RelationalEvidence}'s.
 *
 * <p>A lack about several blocks together and not about any of them, in all but one of these. Each
 * of the blocks named is left values of its own; what has nothing is an assignment to all of them
 * at once, so a claim naming one of them would send an author to a place whose own rules are fine
 * with what they leave it. {@link NoValueLeftForIt} is the one that does name a block, and it says
 * of that block that the denials leave it nothing.
 *
 * <p><b>Not one shape, because it is not one argument.</b> A block stated to differ from itself is
 * refused by reading the rule; a block its neighbours leave no room for anything is refused by
 * narrowing; a set of blocks with fewer values between them than there are blocks is refused by
 * counting; and blocks no assignment of what they hold tells apart are refused by looking for one.
 * Held as the counting one alone, the others would be reported as a shortage of values that no
 * count was taken of — and a reduction learned later is a case added here rather than a sentence
 * somebody has to rewrite.
 *
 * @param <A> what a position is called
