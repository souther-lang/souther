/**
 * A reading of one value's positions, said in full before any of it is worked out.
 *
 * <p>What {@link AdmissibleValues} is, one step earlier. A position holds a description of the
 * values it admits ({@link AdmittedPlan}) rather than the values, and a choice this cannot tell the
 * branches of holds both. Turned into a reading by {@link #resolve}, which builds what has to be
 * built, once, under an allowance.
 *
 * <p><b>Why there are two types.</b> Whether the values are worked out decides which questions may
 * be asked: what a position admits, whether the reading speaks for it, whether anything stands
 * anywhere. Asked of this, every one of them would either be a guess or a machine built at the
 * moment somebody happened to ask — which is how what a clause costs came to depend on where its
 * brackets fell. So this holds only what the fold needs, and the answers live on the other side of
 * {@link #resolve}. There is no way back.
