/**
 * A reading worked out, together with what could not be built while working it out.
 *
 * <p>Two facts settled by one piece of work and handed over together. Which values each position
 * admits is one, and which limit stopped this compiler where it stopped is the other. They are not
 * separable questions — the second is only answerable by doing the work the first needed — and a
 * caller given the first alone has to guess it from what it holds. What it holds is a set widened
 * to every value, and every guess made from that is the wrong one: it reads a position nobody could
 * work out as one the rules left open.
 *
 * <p>Whether anything satisfies the reading is not among them and is not asked here. That is about
 * the values beside where their orders stop ({@code Confinement}), and what this settles enters it
 * as {@link LeftUnbuilt} — the reading is one half of the question and answering it here would be
 * answering for the other half as well.
 *
 * <p><b>The two shortfalls are apart because they are owed to different people.</b> What is about a
 * rule may be filed under that rule and shown to an author as something to change. What is about the
 * answer may not: the same rules in another order would have been built, so there is no rule to
 * name. A store that took either would be a store whose type says less than the model does.
 *
 * <p>Which is why the three of them are not a way in, and why there is no way in that takes the
 * reading alone either. Handed the parts side by side, a caller writes a reading beside shortfalls
 * no work refused; handed the reading, a caller says of a reading that came from somewhere that
 * nothing was refused while it was made, which is a claim about work it did not do and can be false
 * of the very reading it is handed. So one is reached by doing the work
 * ({@link AdmissibleValues#realize}), and there is no second way.
 *
 * <p>{@code aboutARule} is not per position: an allowance is held per position and every rule
 * reaching one pays into it, so the place is what the spending was arranged by and is not what any
 * of it is about.
