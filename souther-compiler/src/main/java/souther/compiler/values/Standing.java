/**
 * Why a reading cannot speak for what stands at a position, and what to tell a reader about it.
 *
 * <p><b>Two kinds of thing, and they are not the same kind.</b> A rule the reading gave up on is
 * one an author wrote and can lift. A position an alternative nothing could read left open is a
 * consequence of one: the choice binds nothing there because a value satisfying the branch nobody
 * read owes the branch that was read nothing, and what an author would go and look at is the clause
 * inside that branch rather than anything written at the position. Both say this reading cannot
 * promise what stands there, so both are weighed when that is asked; only the first is what a
 * reader is told, where there is one.
 *
 * <p>Held apart rather than appended under a rule. Said as one list, which of them a reader is
 * shown is decided by which arrived first — and a walk reaching them the other way round tells an
 * author about the choice above a form they could have lifted.
 *
 * <p>One entry per rule the reading gave up on, holding every position that rule named. Which is
 * what the reading was handed: a rule about two positions is one rule, and a rule about one is one
 * rule, and either way what stopped the reading stopped it once. Filed as a map from position to
 * reasons, that fact came apart on the way in — a rule naming two places became two entries, and
 * the order the author wrote their rules in was recoverable only inside one place.
 *
 * <p><b>Only a producer's face is public.</b> What is here is read to answer whether a reading
 * speaks for what stands at a position and, where it does not, what stopped it
 * ({@link AdmissibleValues#speaksFor}, {@link AdmissibleValues#whyUnread}). Those two are one
 * derivation over the positions that hold one value, and a reader that could take the entries out
 * and look at one position would be answering the same question a second way — which is how a
 * position held as one value with another came to be reported as fully read. So a caller may make
 * one of these and add to it, and everything that reads it is here or beside it.
 *
 * @param <A> what a position is called

     *
     * <p><b>What it is about and not where it was written.</b> Those are the same for a rule
