/**
 * Which values each position may hold, over all the rules a reading took in.
 *
 * <p>A state and not a set. A rule is written about a whole value and may name several of its
 * positions, and the connectives join whole readings rather than the answer at one position — so
 * what a conjunction and a disjunction are applied to is this, and the arithmetic at one position
 * is {@link ValueSet}.
 *
 * <h2>What is held</h2>
 *
 * <p>A union of products, or nothing. A product — a {@link Box} — is one set per position, standing
 * for every value with a value of each set at each place; a union of them is what a choice between
 * alternatives written at two positions leaves, and no one product holds it. How many of them a
 * reading may hold is what a caller bounds; held one at a time, the union is merged back into the
 * smallest box containing it, which is what a reading of these was before it held any.
 *
 * <p><b>Bottom is a state and not always a position.</b> The rules leave nothing where some position
 * is left no value — and also where every alternative of a choice is one nobody can take, which is
 * not a fact about any one position. So a reading that admits nothing is its own case
 * ({@link Held.Nothing}), and not an empty union: an empty union would say that no position can hold
 * anything, which is more than the rules were read to say.
 *
 * <p>Which of the two it is is a question about each position's own rules, and the alternatives
 * cannot answer it: a conjunction meets them pairwise and drops the pairs nothing stands in, so
 * what a dropped pair was going to say about a position leaves with it, and the answer would follow
 * the order the rules were met in. So the reading carries {@link #perPosition} beside them — every
 * position read on its own, by the same connectives — and that is what a reading admitting nothing
 * answers from.
 *
 * <p><b>A position no box holds is at {@link ValueSet#ANY}.</b> That is what makes the two
 * connectives what they are below, and it is the one thing to hold on to while reading them.
 *
 * <pre>
 *     meet             the keys of both, each side missing one standing at ANY
 *     join             the keys of both, each side missing one standing at ANY
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Which reads the same and is not: joining at a key one side does not hold is joining with ANY,
 * and that is ANY — so a join keeps only what both sides spoke about, and a meet keeps everything
 * either did. {@code value == "A" || something-this-cannot-read} has to come out saying nothing
 * about {@code value}, and a join written as a merge of the two maps says {@code "A"}.
 *
 * <h2>What the reading knows about itself</h2>
 *
 * <p>Beside the values, which positions this can speak for. A reading that could not take a rule in
 * leaves the values wider than the rules are, which is the safe direction for refusing a
 * declaration — nothing is admitted that the rules exclude — and the wrong direction for saying
 * that a model divides a position into these classes and no others. The two answers are different
 * questions and are kept apart: {@link #at} says which values, {@link #speaksFor} says whether that
 * is the whole of what the rules leave.
 *
 * <p>What a position holds is answered from two sides. {@link #at} is an upper approximation and
 * {@link #guaranteedAt} a lower one, and between them sits what the rules truly leave:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     guaranteedAt(p)   &#8838;   what is truly admitted at p   &#8838;   at(p)
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>The lower one is what a choice needs. An alternative that admits every value at a position
 * settles it however little was read beside it, and a reading holding only "something went unread"
 * has thrown away what it would take to know that — which is why the two ends are carried and not
 * a flag standing for their difference.
 *
 * <p>Two things spoil it, and the second is the one that is easy to miss.
 *
 * <p>A rule this could not read spoils the positions it names, and what stopped it travels with
 * them ({@link UnreadReason}). It cannot spoil a position it does not name: nothing here relates
 * one position to another, so a rule that narrows a position names it — a rule relating two of them
 * names both, and is itself a rule this cannot read.
 *
 * <p>A rule this could not read spoils, under a disjunction, every position the other branch spoke
 * about, whether or not it names them. {@code value == "A" || opaque()} leaves {@code value} at ANY
 * because a value satisfying the second branch is under no obligation from the first — and ANY
 * arrived at that way is not the ANY of a position nothing was written about. Without this a
 * position would be reported as one the model draws no distinction at, when what happened is that
 * this reading could not follow the distinction the model draws.
 *
 * <p>Unless the alternatives already cover the position, which is the one thing that stops it.
 * {@code (value == "A" || value /= "A") || opaque()} leaves nothing for the unread branch to take
 * back: the two that were read admit every value between them, and a choice one of whose
 * alternatives admits every value at a position admits every value at it. That is what
 * {@link #guaranteedAt} is carried for, and holding "something went unread" alone would answer the
 * same clause two ways depending on where its brackets fell.

     *                alone would have to go back to the rules to find out which it was.
     *
     *                <p><b>Every reason and not the first of them.</b> One position is named by as
     *                many parts of a clause as the author wrote about it, and two of those can stop

     *                lifted by different work. Kept as one, which of the two a reader was shown
     *                turned on the order the parts were met in, and the other was gone with nothing
     *                saying so. In the order they were met, which is the order the author wrote
     *                them, so that two runs over one model produce the same list.
     *
     *                <p><b>Not the positions this cannot speak for.</b> A rule left standing where
     *                the alternatives cover the position between them is one nothing there is
     *                answerable for, and it is held all the same, since whether they still cover it
     *                turns on rules stated beside the choice that have not been read yet.
     *                {@link #speaksFor} and {@link #whyUnread} are the readings; this is what they

     *                disjunction needs in order to know that a branch widened it. What stopped that
     *                rule is not carried: a position the other branch spoke about is spoiled by
     *                there having been an alternative it could not read, and not by whatever the
     *                rule in that alternative was about
     * @param guaranteed which values each position is guaranteed to admit — read through
     *                {@link #guaranteedAt} rather than off this map, which holds a position whose
     *                guarantee is the default as well. Held that way on purpose: the keys are
     *                {@link #promisedAt}, the positions a rule of this reading reached, and
     *                dropping the ones that came to the default would make that set turn on which

     *                over, and both readings would follow the brackets
     * @param defaultGuaranteed what a position this holds no guarantee for is guaranteed to admit.
     *                Not {@link #dropped} said another way: {@code value == 5} joined with a rule
     *                nothing could read has this at {@link ValueSet#ANY} and {@code dropped} set,
     *                because the alternative that was read guarantees every value at every position
     *                it says nothing about, while a rule of the choice did go unread
     * @param guaranteedTogether whether one value may be taken from each position's guarantee and
     *                the whole of them stand together in this reading. What a conjunction needs of
     *                its sides and what a choice over more than one position does not leave
     * @param tangled the positions whose correlations this reading has lost. A union of products
     *                merged back into one product is where that happens, and a choice between
     *                alternatives written at two positions is a union no product states. Outside
     *                this set the relation factors into a product, which is what lets a position no
     *                choice reached keep its own answer
     * @param widened the positions whose {@link #at} cannot be guaranteed to be what the read rules
     *                leave them. A guarantee and not a fact: the rules below are sufficient and not
     *                necessary, so absence from this set is what is shown and presence is what is
     *                not shown either way, and a sharper reading later leaves a position out of it
     *                without anything here changing meaning.
     *
     *                <p>Held per position rather than as one answer for the reading, because the
