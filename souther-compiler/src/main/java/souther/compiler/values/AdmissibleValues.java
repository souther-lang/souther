/**
 * Which values each position may hold, over all the rules a reading took in.
 *
 * <p>A state and not a set. A rule is written about a whole value and may name several of its
 * positions, and a connective composes whole readings rather than the answer at one position — so
 * what a conjunction is applied to is this, and the arithmetic at one position is {@link ValueSet}.
 *
 * <p><b>A choice is taken while a reading is a description.</b> Which alternatives anybody can be
 * in is a question about the whole of what was read of a clause — the values and the order together
 * — so it is settled a layer out, over {@link PlannedValues}, and what is worked out afterwards is
 * worked out from a description a choice has already been taken in. This holds what that choice
 * left, and is asked about it, and is conjoined with the readings of other declarations
 * ({@link ConjoinedAdmissibleValues}); there is no operation here that composes two of these into
 * another choice, and a reader looking for one is looking on the wrong side of {@link
 * PlannedValues#resolve}.
 *
 * <p><b>And a rule of the values enters as a description.</b> There is no word here for a reading
 * of one position, of two positions held as one value, of two held apart, or of a rule nothing
 * could read: those are written as {@link PlannedValues} and worked out. What a leaf minted here
 * would leave out is what working one out settles — what the allowance let it build, and what it
 * went short of — so a caller would be handed a reading whose every position looks worked out and
 * whose shortfall was never asked about. What this side has instead is what a reading already in
 * hand can be put through: {@link #meet} and {@link #metAll}, {@link #renamed} and
 * {@link #alsoOpenedAt}. Beside them is {@link #top}, which is handed nothing and is where a
 * reading starts.
 *
 * <h2>What is held</h2>
 *
 * <p>A union of products, or nothing. A product — a {@link Box} — is one set per position, standing
 * for every value with a value of each set at each place; a union of them is what a choice between
 * alternatives written at two positions leaves, and no one product holds it. How many of them a
 * reading may hold is what a caller bounds; held one at a time, the union is merged back into the
 * smallest box containing it, which is what a reading of these was before it held any.
 *
 * <p><b>Bottom is a state and not always a position.</b> The rules leave nothing where some position
 * is left no value — and also where every alternative of a choice is one nobody can take, which is
 * not a fact about any one position. So a reading that admits nothing is its own case
 * ({@link Held.Nothing}), and not an empty union: an empty union would say that no position can hold
 * anything, which is more than the rules were read to say.
 *
 * <p>Which of the two it is is a question about each position's own rules, and the alternatives
 * cannot answer it: a conjunction meets them pairwise and drops the pairs nothing stands in, so
 * what a dropped pair was going to say about a position leaves with it, and the answer would follow
 * the order the rules were met in. So the reading carries {@link #perPosition} beside them — every
 * position read on its own, by the same connectives — and that is what a reading admitting nothing
 * answers from.
 *
 * <p><b>A position no box holds is at {@link ValueSet#ANY}.</b> That is what makes a connective what
 * it is, and it is the one thing to hold on to while reading {@link #meet} here or a choice over on
 * the description side.
 *
 * <pre>
 *     meet             the keys of both, each side missing one standing at ANY
 *     a choice         the keys of both, each side missing one standing at ANY
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Which reads the same and is not: composing a choice at a key one side does not hold is
 * composing with ANY, and that is ANY — so a choice keeps only what both sides spoke about, and a
 * meet keeps everything either did. {@code value == "A" || something-this-cannot-read} has to come
 * out saying nothing about {@code value}, and a choice written as a merge of the two maps says
 * {@code "A"}.
 *
 * <h2>What the reading knows about itself</h2>
 *
 * <p>Beside the values, which positions this can speak for. A reading that could not take a rule in
 * leaves the values wider than the rules are, which is the safe direction for refusing a
 * declaration — nothing is admitted that the rules exclude — and the wrong direction for saying
 * that a model divides a position into these classes and no others. The two answers are different
 * questions and are kept apart: {@link #at} says which values, {@link #speaksFor} says whether that
 * is the whole of what the rules leave.
 *
 * <p>What a position holds is answered from two sides. {@link #at} is an upper approximation and
 * {@link #guaranteedAt} a lower one, and between them sits what the rules truly leave:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     guaranteedAt(p)   &#8838;   what is truly admitted at p   &#8838;   at(p)
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>The lower one is what a choice needs. An alternative that admits every value at a position
 * settles it however little was read beside it, and a reading holding only "something went unread"
 * has thrown away what it would take to know that — which is why the two ends are carried and not
 * a flag standing for their difference.
 *
 * <p>Two things spoil it, and the second is the one that is easy to miss.
 *
 * <p>A rule this could not read spoils the positions it names, and what stopped it travels with
 * them ({@link UnreadReason}). It cannot spoil a position it does not name: nothing here relates
 * one position to another, so a rule that narrows a position names it — a rule relating two of them
 * names both, and is itself a rule this cannot read.
 *
 * <p>A rule this could not read spoils, under a disjunction, every position the other branch spoke
 * about, whether or not it names them. {@code value == "A" || opaque()} leaves {@code value} at ANY
 * because a value satisfying the second branch is under no obligation from the first — and ANY
 * arrived at that way is not the ANY of a position nothing was written about. Without this a
 * position would be reported as one the model draws no distinction at, when what happened is that
 * this reading could not follow the distinction the model draws.
 *
 * <p>Unless the alternatives already cover the position, which is the one thing that stops it.
 * {@code (value == "A" || value /= "A") || opaque()} leaves nothing for the unread branch to take
 * back: the two that were read admit every value between them, and a choice one of whose
 * alternatives admits every value at a position admits every value at it. That is what
 * {@link #guaranteedAt} is carried for, and holding "something went unread" alone would answer the
 * same clause two ways depending on where its brackets fell.
 *
 * <h2>What a reading may be</h2>
 *
 * <p>The states are the ones the operations above reach, together with {@link #realize}, which is
 * where a description crosses. The parts are not among the ways in.
 *
 * <p>Every paragraph here states a relation between them — a whole that holds nothing is not a
 * position that holds nothing, {@link Held.Nothing} is not an empty union, what a promise is about
 * is the blocks the alternatives agree on — and none of those is a property of one part. So a
 * caller handed the parts side by side could write down a combination nothing read, with nothing to
 * say so; what holds the relations up is that a reading is come by doing to one what the reading
 * says was done to it.

     *                alone would have to go back to the rules to find out which it was.

     *                turned on the order the parts were met in, and the other was gone with nothing
     *                saying so. In the order they were met, which is the order the author wrote
     *                them, so that two runs over one model produce the same list.

     *                <p><b>Not the positions this cannot speak for.</b> A rule left standing where

     *                went unread is a different fact, which nothing about the guarantee says
     * @param guaranteedTogether whether one value may be taken from each position's guarantee and
     *                the whole of them stand together in this reading. What a conjunction needs of

     *                merged back into one product is where that happens, and a choice between

     * @param widened the positions whose {@link #at} cannot be guaranteed to be what the read rules
     *                leave them. A guarantee and not a fact: the rules below are sufficient and not
     *                necessary, so absence from this set is what is shown and presence is what is
