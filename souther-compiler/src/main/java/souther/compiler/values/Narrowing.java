/**
 * Taking from each block the values its denials leave it nowhere to hold.
 *
 * <p><b>What a denial says about one value.</b> {@code p /= q} lets {@code p} hold {@code v} where
 * {@code q} is left some value other than {@code v}, and refuses it where {@code q} is left only
 * {@code v} or nothing at all. So what a step takes away is the values a neighbour leaves no room
 * for, and a neighbour left one value is a case of that rather than what the rule is about. Written
 * as "a block left one value takes it from its neighbours", the same removals happen and the reason
 * is a shape the reading passed through, which is why the rule is said the first way.
 *
 * <p><b>A round reads one reading and writes the next.</b> Every removal a round makes is worked
 * out against what the blocks were left before that round, and none of them against what the round
 * itself has taken. Written into as it goes, a round would take from a block what a neighbour cut
 * down earlier in the same round leaves no room for, and how far it had got when it reached that
 * block is the order the denials happen to be stated in. What that costs is one more round, and
 * what it buys is that the answer is a fact about the relation.
 *
 * <p><b>Which is what makes an emptied block an answer rather than a stopping place.</b> Rounds go
 * on while something moves, and the first round that leaves a block no value at all is what the
 * relation comes to. Run past it, the rule above stops holding — a block left nothing leaves room
 * for no value at all, so it would take every value from every neighbour, and which blocks ended up
 * empty would be settled by which of them was emptied first.
 *
 * <p><b>Walked over the blocks as numbers.</b> A round asks what each block's neighbours are left,
 * which is a question about the same few blocks over and over; read through the blocks themselves
 * it is a lookup apiece, and a reading built for each round is a map of them all copied for what a
 * round changed. So the blocks are numbered once, what they are left is an array, and a reading is
 * made where one is answered with — which is where a reader has one.
