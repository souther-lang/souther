/**
 * Where a reading was left nothing, and what kind of lack it is.
 *
 * <p><b>Two quantifiers and not one set of blocks.</b> A lack at each of some blocks says of every
 * one of them that it holds nothing; a lack about several of them together says that no assignment
 * to all of them stands, while each of them is left values of its own. Held as one set, a reader
 * putting two lacks together intersects them — which is what the first kind means and is an
 * invention for the second, since two collective lacks over sets that overlap have shown nothing
 * about what the two happened to share.
 *
 * <p><b>And both at once, because the two are not alternatives.</b> A conjunction is refused where
 * either side is, so one side refused at a block beside one refused about blocks together is
 * refused both ways, and neither is what it is instead of the other. Held as one of three things a
 * refusal can be, such a conjunction had to give one of them up — and whichever it gave up, what
 * three sides come to is then not the same when the first two are put together first as when the
 * last two are. So a refusal holds what it was refused at and what it was refused about, and either
 * of them may be nothing.
 *
 * <p>Which leaves the two ways of putting refusals together doing the same thing to each half. A
 * conjunction keeps what either side showed ({@link #eitherShown}) and a choice keeps what both
 * showed ({@link #shownByBoth}), so the first is a union of each half and the second a meet of
 * each — and how the sides were bracketed is not something either can answer from.
 *
 * <p><b>Every witness, and what a reader keeps of them is that reader's question.</b> What is built
 * here is what refused an alternative, all of it: a proof that stopped at one kind because it had
 * found the other is a proof whose content is the order its questions were asked in. Reading it
 * back is where witnesses are given up — {@link #nearest} for the one sentence a report writes,
 * {@link #withoutWhatAPositionAnswers} for the ones a reading is the place to keep. Neither of them
 * is done on the way in.
 *
 * <p>Closed, so that the values here are the ones its makers reach. A refusal handed both halves
 * directly is one whose two halves nothing looked for together, which is what this type exists to
 * rule out; every way in is named below and every one of them is exhaustive.
