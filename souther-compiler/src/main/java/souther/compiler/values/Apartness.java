 * nothing said of {@code p}, and the two would disagree about a value they are one of.

     * What these denials come to, against what each block they name is left.
     *
     * <p>Three answers, and the two that are not "nothing stands here" are two different things. An
     * assignment found is a value for every block that no denial refuses, which is what makes
     * {@link Reduction.Standing} a claim rather than a failure to refuse; anything else is
     * {@link Reduction.NotKnown}, which says that this reduction did not settle it and never that
     * something stands.
     *
     * <p><b>Five arguments, in the order it tries them.</b> A block stated to differ from itself is
     * read off the rule. A relation whose blocks are each left more values than they are stated to
     * differ from blocks stands, and is read off the pairs. A block loses every value a neighbour
     * leaves it no room for, and where that leaves it none, nothing stands — narrowed round after
     * round, because a block that loses a value leaves less room for its own neighbours
     * ({@link Narrowing}). A set of blocks each stated to differ from every other needs a value
     * apiece, so where there are fewer values between them than there are blocks, nothing stands.
     * And what none of those reaches is looked for: whether some way of giving the blocks values
     * tells every stated pair apart.
     *
     * <p><b>Every lack the argument that answered shows, and not one of them.</b> Each of these
     * arguments can hold of several blocks at once, and the relation says nothing about which of
     * them to name — a relation two of whose blocks can be swapped for each other is that relation
     * swapped, so a rule choosing one would answer one way for it and another for its image. What
     * there would be to choose by is the order the denials were written or how the positions are
     * spelled, and neither is something the relation holds. So an answer is the whole of what the
     * argument that reached it shows.
     *
     * <p><b>Why the first three stay, once the fourth decides.</b> Not one reason but three.
     *
     * <p>Refusing by reading the rule and by narrowing is what says which blocks the lack is about
     * — one pair, or one block and the ones its values went to — where looking for an assignment
     * can only name the blocks it looked over. Reading the rule is also what the fourth rests on: a
     * block holding
     * more values than the relation has blocks is left out of the search because it can be given
     * one after every other block has, and a block stated to differ from itself is a block no such
     * argument holds for.
     *
     * <p>Counting decides where the fourth is not admitted to look, which is most of what a large
     * relation is. Blocks all stated to differ are refused however many of them there are, and a
     * search over that many blocks is past what it looks through several times over.
     *
     * <p>And narrowing makes the search smaller as well as refusing: a relation whose blocks lose
     * the values their neighbours leave no room for may be inside what the fourth looks through
     * where it was not before. So the three are what decides outside the fourth's reach and what
     * says the lack better inside it, and neither of those is being kept for the sake of the other.
     *
     * <p><b>What it still cannot.</b> A relation whose shape is past what either search is admitted
     * by and whose blocks do not each outnumber their neighbours, and a relation naming a block
     * whose values nothing wrote down. Both are {@link Reduction.NotKnown}, which says that this
     * did not settle it and never that something stands.
     *

     *                  belongs to whoever holds both
