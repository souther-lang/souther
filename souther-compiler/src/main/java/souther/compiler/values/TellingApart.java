/**

 * <p>A question with two answers and no third. Whether an assignment exists is a fact about the
 * blocks and the values, so a reading that ran out of what it allowed itself to do would be
 * answering about its own budget — and which way it went would turn on where the walk started,
 * which is a fact about how the rules were written. So how much work this is, is decided before
 * there is a question to ask it of ({@link #lookingThrough}, which is the only way to hold one), and
 * inside that it is walked to the end.
 *
 * <p><b>Every block's values are written down.</b> A block whose values nobody counted, or whose
 * values are more than a caller was counting, is not one of these — which of those it was, and what
 * follows from leaving it out, belongs to whoever builds the question rather than here.
