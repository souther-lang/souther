/**
 * Which positions of one reading hold one value.
 *
 * <p>A reading is a product, and what it is a product over is settled here. A rule stating that two
 * positions are equal does not narrow either of them: it says the two are one subject, so a rule
 * about the first is a rule about the second and neither of them has an answer of its own any more.
 * Held as a relation beside the sets, that fact reaches whoever remembers to ask; held as what the
 * product is indexed by, every reader of the product has it without asking.
 *
 * <p>So this is a coordinate system and not a domain. Nothing here says which values stand
 * anywhere. What it says is what an answer is an answer about, and the sets, the promises, the
 * proofs of precision and the allowances that pay for machines are all filed under a
 * {@link Block} rather than under a position. A position is what an author wrote, and it reaches
 * those answers through {@link #blockOf}.
 *
 * <p>Two readings of one declaration may hold different ones. An alternative that states an
 * equality is a product over the block it makes; the alternative beside it need not state it. So a
 * partition belongs to the alternative and not to the reading, and what a reading can say about a
 * position across its alternatives is what every one of them holds ({@link #common}).
 *
 * @param <A> what a position is called
