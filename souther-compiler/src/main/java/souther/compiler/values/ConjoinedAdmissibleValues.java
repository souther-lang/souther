/**
 * Several readings of admissible values, held together and not multiplied together.
 *
 * <p>An {@link AdmissibleValues} is a union of products, so a conjunction of two of them distributes
 * — every alternative of one against every alternative of the other. That is right where the two
 * speak about the same positions, and it is what a declaration's own clauses are read with, under a
 * budget counted before any of them is read. Two readings that share no position are a different
 * case: no pair is ever dropped, every product is the two maps put side by side, and the {@code m ×
 * n} alternatives say exactly what the pair {@code (m, n)} says. Expanding there buys nothing and
 * costs the product.
 *
 * <p>Which is not a corner case once readings of several values are said together. Ten parameters of
 * a record whose clauses leave two alternatives are a thousand and twenty-four alternatives, and the
 * budget that admitted each reading was counted per declaration and has nothing to say about their
 * conjunction.
 *
 * <p><b>The factors have pairwise disjoint vocabularies.</b> That is the invariant, and it is what
 * makes the answers exact rather than approximate:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     anyAlternativeAdmits   every factor having one, since an alternative of the conjunction is
 *                            one alternative of each of them side by side
 *     at(subject)            the one factor that names it, since no other says anything about it
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>So a conjunction is kept factored only where keeping it factored loses nothing. Where two
 * factors do share a position, the exact conjunction is the product, and it is {@link
 * AdmissibleValues#meet} that works it out — this decides where that is needed and never what it
 * comes to.
 *
 * <p><b>What is not promised.</b> Not that a conjunction is bounded. Two readings that name the same
 * position, each admitted under a budget of its own, still multiply when they are met, and nothing
 * here stops that: what is bounded is one declaration's reading, and a caller conjoining two of them
 * over one vocabulary is asking for their product. What is promised is that a conjunction pays the
 * product only where the positions actually meet.
 *
 * <p><b>No allowance is held.</b> An {@link Allowance} is what one answer being built may spend, and
 * this is a value rather than an answer under construction — so every operation of it that may put
 * two sets together is told which answer pays ({@link #meet}), and the ones that build nothing take
 * none. Held here, the purse would be the one thing about a conjunction that is not a fact about the
 * readings in it, and a binary operation between two of them would have two to choose from.
 *
 * <p>No join. A choice between alternatives is taken while one declaration is read and while its
 * values are still descriptions, which is below this and before {@link AdmissibleValues} exists at
 * all. A disjunction of two factored conjunctions would have to expand them to be said, and nothing
 * asks for one.
