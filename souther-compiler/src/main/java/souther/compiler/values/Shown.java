 * One lack, and how the readings that showed it reached it.

 * <p>The unit an argument about a relation answers in. A refusal carrying one route for all its
 * lacks could not say which of them that route reached — so two readings refused at different
 * blocks through different rules would have to drop both routes to stay honest, and what an author
 * is sent to read is the rules that took the values rather than a block whose own rules leave it
 * everything.
 *
 * <p>Which is also what lets a refusal be equal to what it is. Held apart from its lack, a route
 * is something a value has to leave out of its own equality to be compared by what it claims;
 * held here, what two readings both showed is asked of the lacks by whoever is asking
 * ({@link Refusal#shownByBoth}), and every value stays equal to what it holds.
 *
 * @param <A> what a position is called
 * @param lack what is claimed
 * @param reached how it was arrived at, which is nothing where the argument read no further than
 *                the blocks the lack names
