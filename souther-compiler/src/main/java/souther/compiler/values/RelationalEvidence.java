/**
 * How a lack about an alternative's blocks was reached, by however many readings reached it.
 *
 * <p>Beside a lack and never part of it. What a lack says is that some blocks are left nothing;
 * what this says is which rules were read to show it. So this is what a report reads to send an
 * author somewhere, and a reader asking whether two arguments showed the same thing asks that of
 * the lack.
 *
 * <p><b>Several routes and not one.</b> Two readings can leave one block no value by taking its
 * values through different blocks, and a choice between them leaves that block no value whichever
 * of them is read — so an author has both lots of rules to answer for. Held as one route, the only
 * sound thing to do with two of them is drop both, and what is left is a report naming a block
 * whose own rules are fine with what they leave it.
 *
 * <p><b>And routes are never run together.</b> Each is the removals of one narrowing, filed under
 * that narrowing's rounds, and a round of one reading is neither earlier nor later than a round of
 * another. Merged into one set of removals, a block of the first would answer for a removal of the
 * second and the walk back through the rounds would follow a path neither reading took.
 *
 * <p>Only narrowing has a route. Reading the rule, counting and looking for an assignment each show
 * their lack of the blocks the lack itself names, so what is carried for them is no route at all.
 *
 * <p>Held in the order they arrived, which nothing reads: an order nobody may read is not an order
 * a value may show, so these are not handed out. What a reader wants of them is where an author is
 * sent, which is {@link #restingOn}.
 *
 * @param <A> what a position is called
