/**
 * What an {@link Incompleteness} is about, as the thing itself rather than as a name and a word for
 * what kind of name it is.
 *
 * <p>A scope and a string are a product, and what they stand for is a sum: each kind of subject is a
 * different thing and answers "is this behavior inside it" a different way. Held as a product, a
 * subject can be spelled for one scope and read for another, and a scope can be added that no reader
 * answers for — which is what happened to {@code POSITION}. Nothing wrote one into the list a report
 * reads, so the branch that would have answered for it was never reached, and the fallback answered
 * true for every behavior in the module.
 *
 * <p>A position knows which behavior it is in, so it says so. Reading that back out of
 * {@code submit/request.kind} would be putting the same distinction back into a string.
 *
 * <p>Deliberately not {@code AxisId}. That is the partition's identity for an axis and it lives
 * there; this is what a reason needs to say whose measurement it counts against. The two happen to
 * be spelled alike and are not the same thing, and the conversion belongs on the partition's side,
 * where the axis is.
