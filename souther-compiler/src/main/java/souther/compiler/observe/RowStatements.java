/**
 * What a row states, made once from what was read of it.
 *
 * <p>The one place a statement is made, so that what {@link RowStatement.Stated} means is decided
 * once. A value that is not there in full, and one larger than what is kept, are both values a
 * reader cannot be given — the first because nothing here has it, the second because carrying it
 * would carry a value nobody wrote — and a row holding one of them hands over nothing and says
 * which value and why.
 *
 * <p>Held to {@link Limits#DEFAULT} and not to limits a caller chooses. What a row's inputs are
 * observed under is that one, so everything a row hands over is held to one size; and a statement
 * whose meaning came from an argument would mean one thing where it was made and another where it
 * was read, which is what a reader of a statement would then have to ask about before it could do
 * anything with the values. How much is kept is a thing to change, in the one place it is written;
 * whose choice it is, is not.
 *
 * <p>What is read here is what the row wrote, and nothing else reaches it. Whether this compile had
 * anything to apply the behavior with is not part of what the row states: a row of a behavior no
 * implementation was found for states the same values as one of a behavior that ran, and a snapshot
 * whose rows said otherwise would be publishing the compile it was taken from. Kept that way by
 * where this stands rather than by a rule to keep: this package is not one the run that applies a
 * behavior can be named from, so a statement made here cannot ask what applied anything.
