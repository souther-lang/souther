/**
 * Whether two values are the same value, and where they are not.
 *
 * <p>Two questions are asked of this and they are not one question. Whether an answer is what a text
 * stated holds an {@link Asserted} against an {@link ObservedValue}: the first carries the names and
 * the forms a text wrote them under, the second is what a value turned out to be, and the two are
 * not one kind of thing. Whether two values that were both arrived at are the same holds an
 * {@link ObservedValue} against another, and nothing about it is a statement.
 *
 * <p>What being the same value means is one answer all the same — a set is its elements whichever
 * side asked, a decimal is the amount it stands for, a value is of its type before it is anything
 * else — so the two questions enter here and walk one walk. {@link Compared} is what that walk
 * reads, and each side is projected into it; a second walk beside this one would be the place a
 * {@code Set} came to be compared in order on one of the two routes.
 *
 * <p>{@code position} is what the declaration says stands here, so it says what the value on the
 * right is: an {@link ObservedValue.Sequence} is a {@code List} and a {@code Set} alike, and which
 * one it is comes from the type that produced it. A text that wrote which collection it meant is
 * held to that, and one that did not — {@code [ 1 ]} is how both are written — is read at what the
 * right-hand value is, since there is nothing else for it to be. An observation states no
 * container of its own, so a value arriving from one is read that way too.
 *
 * <p>What it reads of the declarations is one question ({@link ValueTypes}), so this is the same
 * comparison wherever it is made: by the compile that read the text, and by an output holding what
 * that compile decided.
