 * from is a reader told two things that do not go together — and where the difference is that one
 * side holds a place the other has not got, the place there is to report it at is the value whose
 * places they are ({@link Reason#SHAPE}).
 *
 * <p>{@link #position} is what the declaration says stands at that place. It is carried rather than
 * left to be worked out again, because what a value is there was already decided by the comparison:
 * an observation does not say whether its sequence is a list or a set, and a reader asking that
 * question a second time would be a second reading of it, free to answer differently from the
 * comparison that reported the difference.
