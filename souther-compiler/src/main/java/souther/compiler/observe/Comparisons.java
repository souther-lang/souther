 * The one comparison, for the two faces that are bound to a reading of the declarations.

 * what the declarations say stands inside a value. Whoever supplies that decides part of the
 * answer — a field declared a set is compared without its order, and one nothing declares is
 * compared in the order it stands — so where the reading comes from is what makes a verdict the
 * language's rather than the reader's.
 *
 * <p>Which is why this is not reachable from a statement. A comparison hanging off what a row
 * states is one a reader can make with declarations of its own, and two readings of one row would
 * answer differently about one answer. The faces that ask are bound where they are made: the
 * compile asks with the declarations it read the text against, and a checked program's row asks
 * with the ones that program publishes.

     * none, is read as a value of no type at all and is the same as nothing.

     * <p>Yes or no, and the same walk. What being the same value means — a set is its elements, a
     * decimal is the amount it stands for, a value is of its type first — is answered for both
     * questions in one place, so a fake's table picks the row an execution picks.
     *
     * <p>Of two values that are there, which is what makes yes or no the whole of the answer. An
     * observation that stopped, or that could not read what it met, is not a value: what stands
     * where it stopped may be anything, including the value it is being compared with. Answered
     * "no" for one, this would hand a caller the difference between two values where what it has is
     * the absence of one — and the caller would go on to whatever it does when two values differ.
     * That is what {@link #verdict} says as {@code UNREADABLE} rather than as a value that did not
     * hold, and it is refused here because a yes-or-no has nowhere to say it.
