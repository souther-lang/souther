/**
 * What is true of the language's own operations, as somebody wrote it down.
 *
 * <p>The declarations are the list, and the list is the whole of what this publishes. A fact is
 * written here in the authoring vocabulary — a name for the operation, a word for an argument —
 * and nothing here says the library has such an operation or such an argument. Holding every one
 * of these to the library's own declarations reads signatures, which is the frontend's; it happens
 * once over the whole list ({@code check.OperationFactBinder}), and what comes out of that walk is
 * a value of another kind, in which every name has been read against its declaration
 * ({@code check.BoundOperationFacts}). Every reader of a fact reads that one.
 *
 * <p><b>No lookup here, by design.</b> An index keyed by operation and read off this list would be
 * a way to a fact that does not pass through the binding, and a reader that took it would be
 * holding the authored word and putting the binder's question a second time — with an answer that
 * agrees with the binder's for exactly as long as nobody changes either. So this list is read by
 * one caller, and a reader that wants a fact asks what the binding made of it.
