/**
 * Reads a written fixture as the value it states, against the type of the position it is written in.
 *
 * <p>One reading, and only one. A row's operand runs as compiled code and a {@code partial} helper
 * in it may not stop — so a reading is held to a budget, and a worker that runs out of it is asked
 * to stop and cannot be made to: a fixture reaches no interrupt point, so it may still be inside
 * {@link #expandedValue} holding a binding or a half-walked expansion. An instance is therefore one
 * row's, or one written statement's, and is dropped when that reading ends. Nothing it can still
 * write to — {@link #bindings}, {@link #expanding} — is read by the reading after it.
 *
 * <p>What a reading cannot build, and what did not finish, are a {@link FixtureException} and a
 * {@link StackExhaustedException}. Which diagnostic either becomes, and what a budget is, are not
 * here: this class has no {@code Diagnostic}, no place of its own, and no worker of its own. The
 * row evaluation ({@link ExampleVerifier}) and the reading of a module's written statements each say
 * what a failure means where they are, and they say different things about the same one.
 *
 * <p>Showing a value is here too, though it is not reading one. It needs the generated encoders, the
 * loader and the built value, and both readers above need it — left in either, the other would grow
 * a second copy.
 *
 * <p>Public for one thing only: {@link Construction}, which the adequacy report asks to find out
 * whether a value composed elsewhere builds at this module's boundary. That is this class's own
 * question — putting a value through the decoder a row's fixture goes through is the whole of the
 * answer — and it used to be asked of a row evaluator built with signatures, requirements and a
 * budget it had no rows to spend. Everything else here is package-private, and the constructor is:
 * a reading belongs to whichever of the two readers above started it.
