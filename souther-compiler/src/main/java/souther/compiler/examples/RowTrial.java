/**
 * Running a row nobody has written yet, to see where it goes.
 *
 * <p>What a generator cannot do for itself and cannot be told. Which combination of a body's
 * decisions a composed row sits in is settled by running it: everything up to that point is a
 * reading of the body, and a reading is what may be wrong.
 *
 * <p>The same classes an evaluation runs against, reached the same way a written row reaches them —
 * the values are built through this module's own decoders and handed to the answerer this compile
 * emitted, and a dependency the module states a table for is answered by that table exactly as it is
 * for a row somebody wrote. What differs is that there is no row: no expectation to hold the answer
 * to. What a candidate stands them in with travels
 * with the candidate, because which answer a rule takes is part of what the candidate is; a
 * behavior whose implementation is out of reach still cannot be applied, which is said outright by
 * the layer that would have applied it and comes back as nothing having run — asked of that layer
 * rather than worked out here from what a behavior declares, there being one question and no reason
 * for two answers to it.
 *
 * <p>A run that aborts still went where it went. An invariant refusing the answer, a budget running
 * out, an {@code unreachable} being reached — each of them happens after the row has passed whatever
 * it passed, and what was recorded up to that point is what the row did. So the recording is read on
 * every way out and the failure itself is dropped: nothing here is judging the row, and a generator
 * has no expectation for it to have failed against.
