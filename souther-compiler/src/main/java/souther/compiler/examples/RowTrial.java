/**
 * Running a row nobody has written yet, to see where it goes.
 *
 * <p>What a generator cannot do for itself and cannot be told. Which combination of a body's
 * decisions a composed row sits in is settled by running it: everything up to that point is a
 * reading of the body, and a reading is what may be wrong.
 *
 * <p>The same classes an evaluation runs against, reached the same way a written row reaches them —
 * the values are built through this module's own decoders and handed to the answerer this compile
 * emitted. What differs is that there is no row: no expectation to hold the answer to, no fakes, no
 * stand-ins. So a behavior that depends on another cannot be applied this way, and neither can one
 * whose implementation is out of reach. Both are said outright by the layer that would have applied
 * it, and both come back as nothing having run — which is asked of that layer rather than worked out
 * here from what a behavior declares, there being one question and no reason for two answers to it.
 *
 * <p>A run that aborts still went where it went. An invariant refusing the answer, a budget running
 * out, an {@code unreachable} being reached — each of them happens after the row has passed whatever
 * it passed, and what was recorded up to that point is what the row did. So the recording is read on
 * every way out and the failure itself is dropped: nothing here is judging the row, and a generator
 * has no expectation for it to have failed against.

    /**
     * A way to run rows against one module's generated classes.
     *
     * <p>One loader for the module, defined once here. The values a row hands over have to be
     * instances of the classes the answerer applies, so building them and applying them are two ends
     * of one loader rather than two loaders that agree — and the classes are defined once however
     * many behaviors are searched.
     *
     * <p>The classes have to be the measuring ones. A run of classes emitted without the calls that
     * record where it went is a run nothing was recorded of, which reads exactly like a run that
     * went nowhere — so a caller with unmeasured classes must not build one of these, and every
     * combination would otherwise come back missed.
     *
     * @param steps how many counted points a row may pass, and how deep a recursive helper may go.
     *              A composed row is not a row anyone wrote, so a model that loops on it is this
     *              search's problem to stop rather than an author's to be told about
