/**
 * One explicit entry of a {@code fake} table standing in for a bound behavior: an input and the
 * answer the table states for it.
 *
 * <p>A {@code fake} is a written statement about what a behavior answers, and ADR-0093 compares it
 * with that behavior's recorded rows without giving either precedence. What that check cannot reach
 * is a faked behavior with no rows of its own — nothing is there to compare it with, and every faked
 * behavior in the examples repository is injected. Once an implementation is bound, each entry is an
 * input and an answer in the same form a recorded row is, and nothing new has to be written to run
 * it.
 *
 * <p>Two things come of running them. A row of the behavior that stands this one in ran through the
 * table, so a table that disagrees with the implementation means that row held against an answer
 * nothing produces. And a table usually states inputs the dependency's own rows never mention — they
 * were written to drive a branch of the composite — so running them adds observed evidence for free.
 *
 * <p>{@link #inputs} and {@link #stated} are structural and loader-free, beside the shown text
 * rather than instead of it. What a machine reads and what a person reads must not be one String: a
 * caller arranging the world for an entry would otherwise switch on presentation text, which is the
 * dependence {@link RowKey} was introduced to remove, rebuilt one field over.

     * the caller. What is contributed here is the static half — which rows state the entry's input —
