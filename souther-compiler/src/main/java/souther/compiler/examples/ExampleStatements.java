/**
 * Reads the statements a module writes about one of its behaviors, and reports where two of them
 * answer differently.
 *
 * <p>Nothing is applied. A row of an {@code example} says what a behavior will owe for an input; a
 * {@code fake} table and a {@code with} say what stands in for it while some *other* behavior's row
 * runs. Those are two people writing down an answer to the same question, and where the answers
 * differ the model contradicts itself whichever one is right — which is readable from the text
 * alone, with no behavior run and no result to compare against (#306).
 *
 * <p>Apart from {@link ExampleVerifier} because they answer different questions for different keys
 * and neither reads the other's state. What they share is underneath both: {@link FixtureReader}
 * reads a written fixture as the value it states, and each of these says for itself what a fixture
 * that will not build, or will not finish, means where it is.
 *
 * <p>A written {@code fake} table is built here too, because it is written. A table stands in for a
 * behavior and is read against the rows recorded for it, and a module can write one that neither of
 * those reaches — nothing depends on the faked behavior and no row records what it owes. It still
 * states what it states, and what is wrong with it is wrong wherever it is read from.
 *
 * <p>{@link Standins} is the one place a fake's table is built and the one rule by which a row of it
 * answers ({@link Standins#answering}). Both are shared with the proxy {@link ExampleVerifier}
 * installs while a row runs, deliberately: a second reading of one table is the thing <em>E1919</em>
 * exists to catch, so there must not be a second reading to drift.

     * statement about the same behavior, written for every other row and every other run, and a
