/**
 * Evaluates a module's {@code example}s at compile time and reports any mismatch as a compile error.
 * It mirrors {@link Runner}: it decodes each row's input expressions into the target
 * behavior's parameter types through their derived decoders, has the behavior applied to them, and
 * compares the result against the expected arm (a bare type name) or value (a construction/literal).
 * A failing example fails the build, exactly as a construction whose constant argument breaks its
 * invariant does.
 *
 * <p>What applies the behavior is not here. It is given to the run ({@link Answering}), because every
 * part of applying one is a fact about the loader its classes come from: which class the behavior is,
 * what its constructor takes, and what a stand-in has to be to be taken by it. What is here is what a
 * row <em>means</em> — which value a fixture states, which row of a fake's table answers, what an
 * answer is compared against, what a failure is reported as — and none of that changes with the
 * answerer. A row's inputs cross as {@link Handed} and the answer comes back as whatever the answerer
 * applies, read by the one reading a run has.
 *
 * <p>A row whose behavior this run has something applying is evaluated, and one whose behavior
 * nothing applies is recorded (spec {@code example-pending}). What is refused is a target that is
 * not a behavior at all — a helper {@code let} of that name ({@code E1902}).
 * A {@code depends on} dependency is satisfied by a fake supplied at the example: a
 * {@code with dep = value} on the row (a constant/value dependency) or a {@code fake dep | table}
 * declaration (an input-keyed function dependency). What the fake answers is read here; making it
 * something the behavior can be constructed with is the answerer's ({@link DependencyStandin}).
 * Inputs, expected values, and fake entries are fixtures — literals, newtype constructions, record
 * constructions, and helpers applied to those (ADR-0077), each compiled as a definition of the
 * module and run as one.
 *
 * <p>Two things a row needs are not here, because they are not about what an example means:
 * {@link FixtureReader} reads what a fixture states as the value it states — through
 * {@link NeutralForm} for the form a decoder reads and {@link OperandRunner} for an operand run as the
 * method its module emits — and {@code RowWork} owns the state one row builds up while it is
 * evaluated. {@link RowEvaluation} is what a caller running one row is answered with, which is a
 * different thing from either.
 *
 * <p>What a module <em>wrote</em> is not here either. {@link ExampleStatements} reads a module's
 * written statements against each other and reports where two of them answer differently, which is a
 * different question for a different key and reads none of this class's state. The one thing they
 * share is a fake's table: it is built there ({@link ExampleStatements#standins}) and answers by its
 * own rule ({@link ExampleStatements.Standins#answering}), and the stand-in a row runs against asks
 * the same one — a second reading of one table is what <em>E1919</em> exists to catch.

public final class ExampleVerifier {

    /**
     * Evaluates every example in {@code module}; returns one diagnostic per failing example row
     * (empty when all pass). Does not throw for a failed example — the caller aggregates. A fixture
     * of an imported type decodes against its declaring module's package, which its
     * {@link TypeSymbol} names (a cross-module example).
     *
     * <p>Classes this compile did not generate resolve under {@code parent} — where an example calls
     * into a module that was compiled by another project, that is the loader its classes come from.
     *
     * <p>{@code requirements} says what each behavior takes injected and in what order: the fakes a
     * row supplies are passed to the injecting constructor in that order, which is the same answer
     * the emitter built that constructor from.
     *
     * <p>{@code values} are the values a row may name beyond this module's own: the ones its imports
     * bring in, each already closed over the module that published it (ADR-0074).
     *
     * <p>{@code answering} says what will apply a behavior for each row. The loader is built here
     * because it is this run's — a row's fixtures are decoded and held to their invariants whether or
     * not there is anything to run them against — and it is handed to {@code answering}, which is what
     * makes an answerer applying this compile's own classes one that can only exist over them.
     *
     * <p>{@code artifact} is taken whole rather than as its classes and what they implement. Both are
     * of one compile and a run has no use for a pairing of two, so the loader is built from one half
     * of it and the other half goes to {@code answering} from the same value.
     *
     * <p>{@code declared} is where the declarations of the module the rows are written for are read
     * from, for holding an answer's own against. Given as something to ask rather than as the
     * declarations, because a run whose answers are all this compile's own has nothing to hold and
     * never asks: there are no two builds there, and reading a module's declarations to compare them
     * with themselves is work for an answer nobody could have brought.
     *
     * <p>And it has to be of the module whose rows these are, which is checked here because here is
     * where both are in hand. Past this point the module the rows belong to is gone: an answerer is
     * given a manifest and a loader, and the manifest is what says which module's implementations it
     * applies. A run handed another module's artifact would look that module's behaviors up by name —
     * and a name it has one of would be applied, so a row would be answered by an implementation of
     * something else rather than failing to find anything.
     *
     * <p>{@code contracts} is what the module's behaviors declare of what they answer, which is what
     * says there is a check to run over a row's values. Read from the answer that owns it rather
     * than from the classes: a check that will not load is a compile that did not emit what it said
     * it would, and reading the loader for this would take that for a behavior with nothing to say.
     *
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException where the artifact is of another module
