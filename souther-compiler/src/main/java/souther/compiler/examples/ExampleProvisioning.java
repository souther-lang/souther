/**
 * What stands in for a behavior's requirement while an example runs (spec §example-fakes).
 *
 * <p>Two things may: a {@code with} written on the row, and a {@code fake} table written beside it.
 * The row is looked at first, so a row that answers a dependency itself answers it whatever the
 * module says. A requirement nothing was written for is one nothing can run against, which is
 * E1908; one written for more than once is a refusal said where the blocks are, and the row is
 * left with nothing to run against and nothing of its own to say.
 *
 * <p>Said here rather than inside the verifier that reports it, because the question is asked twice
 * over: once by a run about to build a stand-in, and once by a reader that only wants to know what a
 * row still owes and has no values to build. What was written and where is handed back rather than a
 * yes or no, since those two do different things with it.
 *
 * <p>What a row contributes is the {@code with}s on it, taken as a list rather than as the row, so
 * that a row nobody has written yet can be asked the same question by contributing none.
