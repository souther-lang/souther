/**
 * What a value looks like in the form a derived decoder reads — the *neutral* form an {@code example}
 * fixture is written in, and the one thing both directions of a row have to agree on.
 *
 * <p>A row reaches that form two ways. From what the author wrote, which {@link ExampleVerifier} walks:
 * a literal, a record, a collection, a newtype application. And from a live value, which {@link #of}
 * re-materialises — what a row's operand answered with, on the way into a fixture, and a value
 * this compile built, on the way to an answerer whose classes are not this compile's
 * ({@link Handed}). The rules that decide the form itself — which
 * discriminator a case of a sum carries, when a unit case travels as a bare name, which written list is
 * a map's entries — are the same rules whichever direction arrives at them, so they are here rather
 * than restated on one side and read from the other.
 *
 * <p>Running an example is {@link OperandRunner}'s, and diagnostics are the row's: a form that cannot
 * be reached is a {@link FixtureException}, which the row reports. What is here is the one reading of
 * the classes a run answers with — {@link #typeOf} for which declaration a value is and
 * {@link #simpleName} for what a report quotes — because a live value's type is a question every
 * reader of a run asks and only one answer to it is right.

     * nothing to walk. Issue #683 was this being answered by searching every visible sum for one
     * that lists the case, which is a question about the case rather than about the position it
     * stands at.
     *

     * what a position typed by the case itself writes. Asking the sums that list the case instead is
     * the same question as above with the position dropped from it, and it makes a value's form move
     * when a sum nothing here reads it through is declared.
     *
     * <p>A behavior's answer union does not arrive here. It has no declaration to read a
     * discriminator off, and where its members are all units it is written as a bare tag before this
     * is reached ({@link #readsABareName}) — which is what its generated encoder writes.
     *
     * <p>A field the fixture wrote itself is never replaced. A case whose own field is named like its
     * sum's discriminator is already ambiguous at the boundary — the case encoder and the sum encoder
     * both claim that key — and overwriting here would hide that behind an example that passes while
