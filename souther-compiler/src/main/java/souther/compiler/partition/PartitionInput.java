/**
 * A position the partition derivation may be asked about, and proof that it is one.
 *
 * <p>Holding one of these is the proof. The derivation asks whether a position divides, and answers
 * that it does not — {@code Absent} — only where every producer it has was asked and none of them
 * answered. Which producers those are is a fact about this compiler; what this type adds is the
 * premise underneath it, that the position is one a value can stand at at all. That premise used to
 * be nowhere: the walk took a {@link Type}, and a type it had no arm for fell through the bottom of
 * a chain of {@code if}s into the same answer as a position the model really does not divide.
 *
 * <p>So the premise is the input's type rather than a check the walk repeats. A shape outside the
 * set cannot be carried here, so nothing downstream has to ask again, and what is left for an
 * absence is that the evidence phases were exhausted ({@link PendingPosition}).
 *
 * <p><b>The set is this package's, not the boundary's.</b> Which types reach a behavior's parameter
 * and which reach a data's field are two rules that disagree — an {@code Option} may be a field and
 * may not be a parameter — and neither of them is the question "what may a partition be derived
 * from". Deriving this set from either would make a change over there silently change what is
 * measured over here. Written out, a boundary that starts admitting a new shape stops this compiling
 * until the partition semantics of that shape have been decided.
