/**
 * The rules of the decision one body states.
 *
 * <p>The ways through the body, each carrying the conditions it consulted. Read straight off the
 * evaluation and never assembled from a table of every assignment: what makes a condition absent
 * from a rule is the path having settled before reaching it, so the short-circuit is the rule and
 * there is nothing left to fold afterwards.
 *
 * <p><b>The ways are {@link ValueArrivals}'s and the words for them are this reading's.</b> Which
 * ways a body has is what the body does, and it is answered with no naming at all; a second walk of
 * the body to enumerate them would be a second account of what the body does, free to disagree with
 * the first the day either learns to read a shape. What is this reading's own is
 * {@link DecisionNaming} — which distinctions a way turns on, and what tells one from another.
 *
 * <p>Of the body the analysis reads, which is the tree the language's own operations stand in. A
 * rule an author wrote through one of them is a rule of the model, and the tree that runs has it
 * expanded into what it does — where the ways through the expansion are the operation's and not the
 * author's.
 *
 * <p><b>A path assuming a proposition both ways is not a rule.</b> Two readings of one column that
 * disagree are refused where the ways are joined, so a contradiction never becomes a rule and
 * nothing is dropped for want of a witness.
 *
 * <p>Nothing here says a rule can be reached. A vector says what a row would have to satisfy;
 * whether anything stands there is settled against the rows and a stated search, and is no part of
 * reading the body.
 *
 * @param behavior    whose decision this is
 * @param found       the rules, in the order the reading holds the ways, each with what a run down
 *                    its path would be seen doing
 * @param enumeration whether every way was written down
