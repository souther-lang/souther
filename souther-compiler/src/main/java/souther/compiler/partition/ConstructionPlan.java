/**
 * Where a value has to be built under one parameter, and out of what.
 *
 * <p><b>Not the positions of an input.</b> What a behavior declares it takes is
 * {@link souther.compiler.inputs.InputDomain}'s, and what a row has to compose is this. The two are
 * written with the same {@link TermPath} and are about different things: this goes on until there is
 * a value to build, which is further than a report is about. So a path from here is never looked up
 * over there.
 *
 * <p>Where they do meet is how a position is named. A requirement narrowing a position is written
 * into the path here exactly as the reading writes it, so a class fixed at a position under a
 * refinement is a position this builds at under the same name. Written flat, the two would name one
 * location two ways, and a class the caller fixed would be looked for at a path this plan does not
 * have.
 *
 * <p><b>Worked out once and consumed three ways.</b> What each position may take, the search that
 * chooses one position at a time, and the composing of the chosen values back into a record were
 * three recursions over the same declarations, and the third said so — a value came back null "only
 * where the walk that collected the choices and this one disagree". Holding the positions and the
 * shape they compose back into as one value is what makes that disagreement unsayable rather than
 * something a test has to go looking for.
 *
 * <p><b>Made only by {@link #of}, which is where the requirements are put together.</b> A path the
 * caller fixed a value at states what has to hold for that position to exist, and a caller that also
 * hands over requirements of its own is handing over the second half of one fact rather than a
 * second fact (ADR-0114: coverage and construction use one merge, and neither keeps an account of
 * its own). A constructor a caller could reach is that merge being optional, and one caller took the
 * option: a line at {@code query.tag@Tag} was planned against no requirement at all, and the row
 * offered for it put a {@code NoTag} there.
