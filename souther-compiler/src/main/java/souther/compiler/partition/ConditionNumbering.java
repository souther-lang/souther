/**
 * The conditions one reading of a body met, and the name each of them goes by.
 *
 * <p><b>A register of what was met and not a count of the reading.</b> A subtree is read as a
 * condition more than once — the walk reads a short-circuit operator's left operand to say what
 * stands past it, and reads it again inside whatever encloses it — and every one of those readings
 * is of the same condition. Counted per reading, one condition would wear as many names as the
 * shape of the tree happens to produce, and a reader joining two accounts on the name would join
 * them on nothing.
 *
 * <p>So a name and what it names are one act: the first reading of a site asks for the next name,
 * and every reading after it is answered with what the first came to. A number paired with a
 * condition anywhere else would be that correspondence built a second time, by something that had
 * not done the recognising.
 *
 * <p><b>One of these per body read, and every condition of that reading takes its name here.</b> A
 * condition of a guard and an arm of a fork are both things a row had to satisfy to get somewhere,
 * so they are counted together: numbered apart, two of them would wear one name and nothing
 * downstream could tell them apart.
 *
 * <p>It also says which question places a condition, because that is settled where the condition is
 * read and nowhere else. Whether the code is written somewhere a reader can open is what a position
 * already says, and it is the one thing about a position that survives the code moving — so it is
 * the last thing read off the position, and what comes out is which question a report puts later.
 *
 * <p>Where the answer is this reading's own, the place is written down in the same act. So there is
 * one entry per condition a report can ask about and none for the ones whose construct a reader can
 * go and open.

     * which node the reading arrived at, which is an identity question: a node is the same site as
     * itself and as nothing else, and asking a whole subtree whether it says what another says
     * would make what it costs to name a condition grow with the tree the condition is in. Today
     * either comparison would tell the nodes apart — a {@link Core} node carries where it stands —
     * so what is settled here is which question a site is, not which nodes happen to be told apart.

     * standing for a truth are looked through on the way in, so a condition reached through one is
     * the same condition as the one reached without.
