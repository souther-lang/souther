/**
 * A figure this compiler holds a piece of its own work to.
 *
 * <p>What reaching one does is the member's to say and not this sentence's — one of them changes
 * how the work is done and gives nothing up at all. So what they have in common is only that
 * somebody wrote a bound down and that raising it is a thing a person could decide to do.
 *
 * <p>One member per place that reaches a figure, and the figure is here rather than at the place.
 * What a reader wants to know is which of these was reached, and a name written beside a number
 * somewhere else is a second declaration of the same policy — the two part the first time one of
 * them is raised.
 *
 * <p><b>A cause and not an outcome.</b> Reaching one of these says what this compiler declined to
 * do and says nothing about the model: the value it did not build may be the easiest one in the
 * file to write by hand. What the reaching did is a separate question, and it is not one question:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>a search goes no further, and what it had reached is carried out with the figure;
 * <li>another thing a search runs against goes no further — a plan short of the value's positions
 *     leaves a search that ran to the end of less than the point had;
 * <li>nothing is given up at all, and the work carries on by a wider way that omits none of it.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>So a reader may not take a member for any of the three. The first two are carried and the
 * third is not, and which a member is is written where the member is — including, for the third,
 * why there is nothing to carry. A figure named here with no carrier and no such sentence is one
 * somebody has not finished.
 *
 * <p>Nor does the first divide once and for all. A search that had produced nothing when it stopped
 * leaves the point unestablished, and one that had produced something leaves an offer that is some
 * of what there was — so the same member appears on both sides and is neither of them.
 *
 * <p>The figures are read through {@link #maximum()} and are not all written down. One of them is
 * how many shapes a decomposition is offered in, which is how many the walk has — read off the walk,
 * so that a shape added there is a budget raised here and not a number that stayed behind.
