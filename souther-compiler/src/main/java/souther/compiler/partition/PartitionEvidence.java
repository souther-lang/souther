/**
 * One thing a rule of the model states about a position's values, which this stage owes an answer
 * about.
 *
 * <p>Three variants of one kind and not three kinds. A rule either says where a run of values ends
 * and the next begins, or puts one value in a class of its own, or tells a set of values from the
 * rest — and all three are the reading of the rules arriving at something a position may be divided
 * by. A reader wanting all of what was said about a position wants all of them, which is one list.
 *
 * <p><b>What a rule states, and not what it was found to do.</b> One of these divides the position
 * wherever the position holds values on both sides of what it says, and that is a fact about the
 * position's own values rather than about the rule — so it is settled where they are known, and
 * what became of each of these is one of the answers this stage gives ({@link EvidenceAccount}).
 * Named for the dividing, the type would promise of every value it holds a thing that is true of
 * some, and the readings that make them have no way to tell which.
 *
 * <p>So the list of these is what a reading answers with, and the projections below are read off it.
 *
 * <p><b>A line is not the shape of the kind.</b> Two of these draw one, and the third does not: a
 * predicate over the strings at a position names a set, and there is no place a row stands at
 * against it, no side of a value it keeps and no neighbour on the other side. So nothing here asks
 * for a line — a reader that wants one asks the variant that has one, and a variant with nothing
 * true to say about a line cannot be made to answer with something invented.
 *
 * <p><b>Not an identity, before filing.</b> One rule about a name every case of a sum spreads is
 * filed at each of those positions, and what the partition is owed is each of them. The identity of
 * a filed one is {@link #id}, which is that expansion's answer and not this reading's.
