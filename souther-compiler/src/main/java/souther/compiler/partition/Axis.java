/**
 * One measure a model makes of a number of its input: the classes it divides that number into, and
 * the lines it draws on it.
 *
 * <p>The model's own distinctions, not invented ones. A type with two cases has two classes; a
 * {@code guard}'s comparison divides what a position holds into the two sides it treats differently.
 * A position the model says nothing about — a plain {@code String}, an {@code Int} with no invariant
 * — is measured at nothing and has no measure at all, which the position says
 * ({@link PositionMeasurements}) and a report names as not derivable, rather than being filled in
 * with values nobody asked for. The choice matters: a made-up partition measures a rule the model
 * does not have, and reports coverage of it.
 *
 * <p>A bound is not one of them. An invariant's bound gives a boundary and no partition: everything
 * outside it is refused at construction, so there is no class on the far side to cover (ADR-0090),
 * and what such a position gets is {@link #cuts} and no classes — which is what
 * {@link #asksForARow} is for. What a bound does contribute to a partition is the range the classes are clipped to: the
 * two either side of a {@code guard} at 50 run from the bound and not from the type's own ends.
 *
 * <p>{@link #classes} is the one denominator. What a report counts, what a pair space is the
 * product of, and what the generator offers rows for all come from there — three derivations of the
 * same universe are three chances to disagree about it, which is how a class nothing can reach came
 * to be asked for by three measures at once. Nothing a body writes narrows it: a case an arm
 * declares cannot arrive is a claim about the same position, and what became of the claim is said
 * beside the report rather than taken out of the count — a claim the rules bear out has already
 * left, because the reading these classes come from is what took it out.
 *
 * <p>Where the number is measured, and nothing about what stands there. What a value at the
 * position looks like and what order its number is counted on are two questions the reading of the
 * input answers, and every reader of a measure can reach that reading. Held here as well, the two
 * would be answers a reader could take from either place, and the day they part is the day a row is
 * composed at a place one of them says nothing is written.
 *
 * @param term    the number this axis is of: a location's own content, or something taken of it.
 *                Answered by one input position and held as such, because that is what an axis is:
 *                a run of classes over the values of a number a row can be asked for somewhere. A
 *                number read from a run of a sequence has no such place, so it draws a line without
 *                dividing anything and never arrives here
 * @param classes exclusive and exhaustive over the term's values, or empty where the model does
 *                not divide them
 * @param cuts    the values the classes meet at, each carrying every rule that drew it there
 * @param parted  where the rules part this position's values, which is not the same list. A cut is
 *                a value a row can be written against and a bound has one without parting
 *                anything; a rule that wrote a multiple of the position parts its values where the
 *                position may hold none, and has no cut. What every border on this position owes
 *                away from its line is a run of what these leave together, and the cuts alone are
 *                short of the lines that have no value
