 * composing a row asks what this path came out as, and a reader placing the point of a line asks
 * which rules carry <em>this</em> condition at all.
 *
 * <p><b>Not a position, and not a place.</b> Positions are a condition's operands — {@code x < y}
 * is one distinction over two of them — and where a condition is written tells one from another
 * only for as long as no two of them are written alike. So each shape below is told apart by what
 * it means, and the one shape with no meaning to be told apart by says so by being that shape.
 *
 * <p>Which is what keeps the table exclusive. Two writings of one inequality over one form are one
 * column, and a table with a column apiece for them admits an assignment where one proposition
 * holds and does not — an assignment no row can be written at and nothing can show impossible.
