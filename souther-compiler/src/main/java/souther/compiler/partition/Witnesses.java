/**
 * Values built to hold what a rule says a value must hold.
 *
 * <p>What stands for a type used to come from the carrier alone — the empty one for every collection,
 * one character for a string — and a rule saying the collection is not empty is then the one rule that
 * refuses the one value on offer. Read the minimum before the value is chosen and it is instead the
 * size the value is built at.
 *
 * <p>Proposals, and every one of them. Nothing here decides whether a newtype accepts what it is
 * handed: that is the decoder's answer and it is asked afterwards, which is what lets a value be built
 * from the part of a rule this can read while the rest of the rule refuses it. A position offering one
 * value is exactly the defect this is about, so a value built around another carries every proposal the
 * inner one made — a format and a minimum reaching the decoder separately at a position is a choice
 * that has to keep reaching it from inside a collection.
 *
 * <p>Which is why a map's key and value meet each other. They are two parts of one value and the
 * search around this is over the behavior's positions, so a key at its second proposal beside a value
 * at its first is a map nothing outside here can arrive at. Nearest first, so that a search which stops
 * has walked the low proposals of both rather than every one of the key's against the value's first.
 *
 * <p>What is bounded is what this invents rather than what it read. A set's second element and a map's
 * second key are variations made up to tell values apart, and they stop as soon as there are enough;
 * the count a rule asked for stops being worth building long before a row carrying it is one anybody
 * would read. Nothing prunes a candidate some rule was read to produce — the search that walks them is
 * bounded and says so when it stops, which is the honest place for a limit.
 *
 * <p>A tree, because a collection holds values that have rules of their own, and what stands for a list
 * of a newtype is what stands for that newtype in a list. That question is the one the position itself
 * asked, so it is asked of the same chooser. A type written in terms of itself would ask it forever, so
 * the names being expanded are carried down and a name met twice is given up on — which is the right
 * answer there, since no value of such a type exists.

     * <p>What the type divides into comes first. A {@code Bool} is two values and a sum is its cases,

     * is built from both of them or from nothing. Then values made by stepping the carrier, which stay
     * inside the rules the type carries. The type's own proposals come last: each is what one rule
     * asked for and any of them may be one the whole of the rules refuses, so a collection filled from
     * them is refused for its elements — which is still better than a collection short of its size,
     * and is all there is where the carrier neither divides nor steps.
