/**
 * A rule that drew a line, as a boundary reader met it.
 *
 * <p><b>A line, and that is what the name says.</b> Everything below the identity is about one: what
 * the rule placed on the values either side of what it wrote, which of its lines this is, which
 * point a row against it stands at, what a declaration is owed for it. So a rule that divides a
 * position without drawing a line is not one of these — it is the other kind of reading a piece of
 * rule evidence carries ({@link PredicateOrigin}), and what the two share is identity alone
 * ({@link RuleEvidenceOrigin}). Named for neither, this type was one a predicate looked as
 * though it belonged in, and putting one here would have made the line's answers total over a
 * reading that has no line.
 *
 * <p>{@link RuleRef} and what is true of it here. Which rule it is is the same value however many
 * times the rule is read, and everything beside it on these records is an answer about this reading
 * of it: where the comparison's own value is recorded, which arms witness it, which side of the
 * line the cut value falls on, which declarations took an end in. None of those tell one rule from
 * another, and a question keyed on them is a question the reading raised rather than the model.
 *
 * <p>Four identities and not one, because they are four equivalences. {@link RuleRef} answers whose
 * rule it is; {@link AuthoredLine} answers which of that rule's lines was drawn; this answers which
 * reading of that line a boundary was drawn off; and {@link BoundaryLine} answers which of them a
 * partition folds into one. A guard inside a helper is read once per call: those are several of
 * these, one {@code RuleRef}, one authored line, and one line.
 *
 * <p>Kept per cut rather than per axis. Several rules can put a cut at the same value — a type's
 * invariant and a {@code guard} that repeats it, or two guards written in different behaviors — and
 * they merge into one partition while staying separate obligations. Reaching the boundary through one
 * guard says nothing about the other.
