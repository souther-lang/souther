/**
 * One line a rule drew, and what a row is owed at each of its four points.
 *
 * <p>The unit the technique keys on. Domain testing asks for an {@code ON}, an {@code OFF}, an
 * {@code IN} and an {@code OUT} point per border, and the same value can be one role for one border
 * and another role for the next — so what owes the four is a border, and nothing else can be asked.
 * Two of the four used to be answered here as separate obligations, and the other two by the measure
 * that counts how many of a position's classes some row is in: one technique's items split across two
 * units, only one of which a report could say anything about a border with.
 *
 * <p><b>One reading, whatever the rule cut.</b> Where the four points are is a question about the
 * order the quantity's own values sit on, and about nothing else — so a bound on a position, a rule
 * relating two positions and a rule over an arithmetic form are read here by one procedure. Written
 * as a procedure per shape of line, the two that existed answered the same question by different
 * reasoning and a third would have been a third reasoning.
 *
 * <p><b>Total over {@link PointRole}.</b> Every border answers for every role, and the answer for a
 * role nobody is owed a row in is a reason ({@link Demand.NotOwed}) rather than an entry left out.
 * That is checked here and not by a test: the entries used to be built by a loop that added an
 * obligation where it had one and did nothing where it did not, so four different facts — the rules
 * refusing the far side, an order with no next value, a side one value wide, a rule that names a
 * value instead of a side — all arrived as a shorter list. A role that goes missing now stops the
 * build where the border is made.
 *
 * <p>Which rule drew it and which line of that rule is {@link #origin}'s, which reading of that line
 * this is is the origin's too, and which of those readings are one line is {@link BoundaryLine}'s.
 * This is not another identity: a border is a line together with what it owes, and two readings of
 * one line owe the same four things.
 *
 * @param cut     where the line is: what is cut, and where on it
 * @param origin  the rule that drew it, as this reading met it
 * @param answers one entry per role, always four of them

     * every pair of decimals further apart than a line is a pair, and reading the missing step as a
     * missing side took the {@code IN} point off every border over them.
