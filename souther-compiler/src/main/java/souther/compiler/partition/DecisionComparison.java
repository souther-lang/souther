 * 700} are one proposition here for the reason they are one over a position.
 *

 * overlap: a comparison every operand of which is a number of the input is read there and a line is
 * drawn on it, and one this answers names at least one answer, which no term of the input is. So a
 * comparison is read once, and a column of the table and a border on the same comparison cannot
 * come from two readings that disagree.
