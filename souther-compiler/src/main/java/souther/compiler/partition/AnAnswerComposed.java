/**
 * A value for one answer a rule asks something of.
 *
 * <p>The same realization a value at a position goes through, asked about a type rather than about
 * a behavior's input. What a demand asks — a case, a truth, a comparison — is what a way already
 * asks of a position, so what composes a value for one composes a value for the other, and a second
 * composer written here would be a second answer to which values a type's own rules leave.
 *
 * <p><b>An adapter and not a promotion.</b> The subject handed in stands for one value and is read
 * by nothing else: an answer is not a position of anybody's input, and what a search may assume
 * about an input is not what a row may pin a dependency to. Where such a subject is made is where
 * every reading of a behavior's input is made, so that nothing here is a second maker of one. What
 * leaves is the value, which belongs to whoever asked.
 *
 * <p>Nothing put through a decoder. What certifies a composed answer is the run: a row is stood up
 * with it, applied, and asked which rule it took, and a value the model refuses is a stand-in that
 * will not build and a rule left where it was. So a value from here is a candidate and never a
 * witness — which is the same standing a value composed at a position has before its row is run.
