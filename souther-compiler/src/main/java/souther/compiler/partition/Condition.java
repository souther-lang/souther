/**
 * What a condition of a body is made of.
 *
 * <p><b>One reading, because three readers were each making their own.</b> Which comparisons a fork
 * turns on, what each of them stands under, and what an arm proves are three questions about one
 * structure — and each was answered by matching on the shape of the {@link Core} node in front of
 * it. So each knew, on its own, which shapes are transparent, which combine, which are something to
 * say about, and which are where this compiler stops. A shape one of them learned to see through was
 * a shape the others still could not.
 *
 * <p>They came apart where a helper is called in a condition. An expanded helper binds the call's
 * argument to its own parameter, so what stands in the condition is a binding around the comparison
 * rather than the comparison — and the reading that finds comparisons anywhere in a condition saw it
 * and reported it as a rule written in a form this compiler does not read, while the reading that
 * draws lines never reached it at all. One line went missing, the position it divides came back
 * divided no way, and the region a guard beside it is searched in lost what that comparison
 * establishes. All from moving a comparison into a {@code let}, which changes nothing about what the
 * model says.
 *
 * <p>So the vocabulary is here and the readers fold over it. Three shapes:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link Joined} — two conditions put together, with what their connective makes of them;
 *   <li>{@link Compares} — one comparison, with the reading of the names in force where it stands;
 *   <li>{@link Truth} — a value the body asks for the truth of, with the same reading beside it.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Three shapes and no fourth for what was not recognised.</b> A condition is a {@code Bool},
 * so a subtree that is neither of the first two is the body asking whether that value holds — which
 * is a distinction it draws whether or not anything here can say what the value is. Written as a
 * shape that says nothing, every such condition was one thing, and a reader with words for the
 * value in front of it had nowhere to put them.
 *
 * <p><b>A binding is transparent and is not one of the shapes.</b> What a {@code let} contributes is
 * where the names in its body point, which is why {@link Compares} carries the reading rather than
 * every reader threading one alongside. Carried as a shape instead, each reader would have to know
 * to look through it, which is the arrangement this replaces.
 *
 * <p><b>Not a way of finding comparisons.</b> This says what a boolean subtree means, and it used to
 * be walked to visit the comparisons inside one as well. A walk of a subtree needs a root, the root
 * anything ever gave it was a fork's condition, and so what a row had satisfied on the way to a
 * comparison was established only where a fork was written — {@code A && B} said nothing about
 * {@code B} where {@code if A then B else false} did. Which comparisons a body holds is
 * {@link souther.compiler.coverage.ComparisonCatalog}'s and where each of them stands is
 * {@link ComparisonReadings}'s, and neither has a root to be given.
