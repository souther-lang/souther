/**
 * What one run of the generator is asked for, and the only place it is said.
 *
 * <p>A class of a position no row sits in and an arm of the body no row goes through are the two
 * things a row can be owed for. Which of them a run is asked about is established by whoever read
 * the rows, and this carries that reading whole — so a search does not work the list out a second
 * time, and nothing downstream decides from what a search happened to touch.
 *
 * <p><b>Settled before anything that can stop the run.</b> The classes would not link, the rows
 * could not be read: each of those ends a generation, and each used to end it somewhere that had
 * never asked what was owed. What a reader of such a result got was a reason about the run and no
 * word about the thing they were asking after. Made here, every way out holds the same list.
 *
 * <p><b>Lists rather than sets, and the order is the contract.</b> What a row is composed for is
 * written out beside it, and the order those are written in is this order — so a plan handed over
 * as a set would leave the rows of one model coming out in whatever order a hash gave them, which
 * is not the same order twice. Each obligation appears once, which is the whole of what being a set
 * gave.
 *
 * @param subject     the behavior a row would be written for
 * @param classesOwed one class of one position apiece, in the order they were gathered
 * @param armsOwed    one arm apiece, in the order the plan numbered them
