    /**
     * What the model divides one behavior into: every position, every line, and what the reading
     * that produced them could not settle.
     *
     * <p><b>What it is, and nothing about who read it.</b> The reading of the declarations is what
     * this is worked out from, and it used to be carried here as well — so the geometry compared by
     * which reading had built it, and could not be an answer this compiler keeps. It is one now, and
     * the reading is handed to the few places that go on asking it further questions.
     *
     * <p><b>Every line, and not the makings of some of them.</b> A line between two positions was
     * held here as a {@link Border} while a line on one position was held as the cuts it would be
     * assembled from — so what borders a behavior has was settled by whoever assembled them, from a
     * reading of the declarations made where the assembling happened. Two readers therefore had two
     * chances to disagree about which lines exist, which is the thing this being one answer is for.
     *
     * @param unanswered the questions the rules of this behavior's inputs raise that nothing
     *                answered. Beside the axes and not inside one: the model raises them and an
     *                axis is one reader of them, so a position no axis came back for still has
     *                whatever was written about it — and an axis is re-pointed at another number as
     *                a body's rules are read, which would carry a question about one number onto
     *                another
     * @param measurements the locations of this behavior's input this phase answers for, in the
     *                order the reading found them, each holding the numbers it is measured at. A
     *                location is measured at as many numbers as the rules name of it — {@code
     *                Time.hour(slot.at)} and {@code Time.minute(slot.at)} are two measures at one
     *                location — and none is as much an answer as one. What a behavior is measured
     *                at is settled by what its types say and by what its body compares, and a count
     *                of either is not a measure of what any of that costs (see this package's
     *                documentation). Both {@link #positions()} and {@link #axes()} are read off
     *                this, so which measure answers for which location is what the model said and
     *                not a rule a reader invented
     * @param between the lines drawn between two positions, which divide neither of them
     * @param along   the lines drawn on one position, by the measure they are on. Every measure a
     *                row can be written against has an entry, and one that parts a number where
     *                the position holds no value has no line to have one for
     * @param inputIsEmpty the proof that the rules reaching this input leave no value at all, or
     *                null where no such proof was found. One fact about the behavior and not one per
     *                rule or per position: two clauses each admitting values are empty together, so
     *                neither of them is the one at fault and there is no position for it to be
     *                about. Null is "not proved empty" and never "there is a value" — what a proof
     *                of emptiness has no proof of is not the opposite claim
