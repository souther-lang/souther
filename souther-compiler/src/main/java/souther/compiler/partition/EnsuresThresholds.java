/**
 * The values a behavior's own {@code ensures} compares its inputs against.
 *
 * <p>A model states thresholds in more than one place. "Nothing is looked up below the first id" is
 * not in any type and is not in the body either — it is what the declaration says the behavior may
 * answer — and {@code ensures asked = NotFound -> id.value > 0} draws a line at zero as much as a
 * {@code guard} comparing the same number does.
 *
 * <p>Met by writing the value, which is where this parts from {@link GuardThresholds}, and the two
 * are not measuring the same thing. A guard's line is about control flow: the comparison is a place
 * in a body, a value can arrive at the behavior's input and never arrive there, and meeting the line
 * takes getting it to answer. A clause states a relation the behavior is held to, and its line is
 * covered by the input the relation changes at — so what meets it is a row writing that value, and
 * nothing about the run is asked. Whether some evaluation of the clause reached that conjunct is a
 * different question and not the one a boundary measures. The line still has values either side, so
 * a row is owed at the value and beside it — which is neither of the two accounts that were here
 * before, and is why the origin answers what meeting it takes rather than being read off which arm
 * it is.
 *
 * <p><b>Only what a rule requires.</b> A conjunct is part of what the rule asks of an answer, so the
 * relation changes where it does; a disjunct is not — {@code id.value > 0 || id.flagged} is
 * satisfied wherever the other side is, whatever the comparison comes to, so the relation does not
 * change at zero. Reading a line off one would put a distinction into the partition that the model
 * never drew. So the walk descends through {@code &&} and through what a {@code let} binds, which
 * is not a choice either, and stops at everything else.
 *
 * <p><b>And only about an input.</b> A comparison reading {@code value} is a line on the answer, and
 * a row cannot be written at one: what a row chooses is what the behavior is applied to. Such a
 * comparison is turned away by name rather than by drawing nothing — {@link ComparisonAssessment}
 * answers that it is about the answer, and what it raises is nothing rather than a question about
 * an input. Left to fall out as an expression this could not place, the clause was read as a rule
 * about a pair of inputs, which owes a row where the two hold one count; nothing reaches that place,
 * and the report named a rule unaccounted for that nothing could account for (issue #1013).
 *
 * <p>Two shapes of line, the two a body's conditions draw. One at a count of a position, which
 * divides it; one between two positions, which divides neither and is on neither — asked where the
 * first came to nothing and about the same comparison, since a comparison this could not read as a
 * count of one position may still be one between two.
