/**
 * Which rule of a body's decision each run took.
 *
 * <p>What discharges a decision rule is a row whose evaluation takes that path, so this is where a
 * run and a rule meet. The rule is read off the tree the language's operations stand in and the run
 * is recorded where they are expanded; what the two agree about is the construct of the model, and
 * the plan says where the emitter numbered each one.
 *
 * <p><b>A rule is taken where every condition on its path was seen coming out the way the rule
 * says.</b> Not where some of them were: the conditions of a path are what makes it that path, and
 * a run that matched all but one took a different one.
 *
 * <p><b>And a rule no run can be recognised at is not refuted by any run.</b> A path carrying a
 * condition with no construct of the model to be seen at, or one the emitter numbered no site for,
 * is one this compiler cannot tell a run took — so it is set aside rather than answered no, which
 * would report the rules a body has as rules its rows never reach.
