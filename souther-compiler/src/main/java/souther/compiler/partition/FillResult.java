/**
 * What one run of the generator came to, against the plan it was asked with.
 *
 * <p>A fill is total over its plan. Every class and every arm the plan names has an entry saying
 * what became of it, and the constructor is where that is settled — so a way out of the search that
 * writes no entry is a value nothing can build, rather than a silence a reader downstream has to
 * make something of. What such a reader used to make of it was a sentence saying the generator had
 * failed to say, which was true and was the only thing left to say.
 *
 * <p>Apart from {@link Generator.GenerationResult}, which is what a generation with no plan comes
 * to. The rows offered at a behavior's boundaries are composed for points nobody was asked about
 * and nothing is owed at, and holding both in one shape meant a result that had dropped its
 * obligations and one that never had any were the same value.
 *
 * <p><b>What a row was composed for is not held here.</b> It is read back off the discharge, which
 * is the one place that says which obligation a row answered. Written down beside the row as well,
 * the two came apart: a row composed for a class and later found to take an arm was merged into one
 * line, and the class's own entry went on holding the line from before the merge.
 *
 * @param plan       what this run was asked for
 * @param composed   the rows, in the order they were composed, which is the order a reader is
 *                   offered them in
 * @param unresolved what each place a row was looked for came to, said once apiece
 * @param reasons    what happened to this run as a whole, which is never an answer about one thing
 *                   the plan named
 * @param discharge  what became of each of them
