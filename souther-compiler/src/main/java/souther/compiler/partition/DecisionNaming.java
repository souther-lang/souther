/**
 * How the decision a body states writes down what got a run to an answer.
 *
 * <p>The reader-specific half of {@link souther.compiler.flow.ValueArrivals}. What the ways through
 * a body are is the body's own answer and is computed with no naming at all; which distinctions each
 * way turns on, and what tells one from another, is this.
 *
 * <p><b>Its own naming beside the one the combinations use.</b> That one writes a way as a class of
 * one position and tells two readings of one proposition apart by where each is written, which is
 * right for a reading whose places are run-time events. A decision rule is told apart by the
 * proposition: two writings of one inequality are one column, and a table with a column apiece
 * admits an assignment where a proposition holds and does not.
 *
 * <p><b>A condition this has no words for is a column and not a silence.</b> Answering null would
 * leave the way carrying every other condition and saying nothing about this one, which reads as a
 * rule that turns on less than it does. So a shape the arithmetic cannot state comes back as a
 * column the reading admits it cannot say the meaning of, and the way stays whole.
 *
 * <p>What does answer null is a fork whose ways could not all be written down. There is no condition
 * there to name — the reading fell short of enumerating them — so the way is
 * {@link souther.compiler.flow.Completeness#PARTIAL}, which is what a measurement that could not be
 * made in full says of itself.
