/**
 * One position of a behavior's input, and what this phase is left answering for at it.
 *
 * <p>Held once for the position, with the measures made of it under it
 * ({@link PositionMeasurements}), because a position is measured at as many numbers as the rules
 * name of it and none of what is here is one of those numbers. Where the walk stopped, what the
 * reading of the declarations left standing, and what the position is if nothing answers are facts
 * about the location — true of it once, whether it is measured at its own content, at how long it
 * is, at both, or at nothing.
 *
 * <p><b>Kept on the position and not on a measure of it.</b> Whether a position is still waiting on
 * anything is a question about the location ({@link PendingPosition}), and a measure that could
 * answer it lets any reader ask through whichever number it happens to hold. Which one that is
 * decides nothing, so a reader that has to pick has been handed the wrong thing.
 *
 * <p>A measure holds none of this. What a measure needs of the location is what stands there, and
 * it has that; a copy of the rest per measure would be a fact with as many representations as the
 * position has numbers, and any of them may be rebuilt without one of its parts — which is what
 * {@link ReadingResidue} guards one field at a time.
 *
 * @param pending  where nothing has answered for this position yet, what the structural reading
 *                 found — and so what the position is left with if nothing else answers. Null where
 *                 the reading of the declarations already answered, which needs no fallback
 * @param standing the questions the rules of this position raise that nothing answered, empty
 *                 where every one of them was answered. The accounting's answer and not a reading's:
 *                 a rule is answered by whichever reading took it in, so a reading that was short
 *                 of a rule another one read leaves nothing standing here

     * <p>Asked here, where both facts are, and read by everything that has to know. A verdict about
