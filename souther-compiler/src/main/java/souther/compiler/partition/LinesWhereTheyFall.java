/**
 * What a model measures, at the positions the name it is written at was filed — and where it was
 * written, where it was filed nowhere.
 *
 * <p>A rule names a location in the words of the value it was written in, and a row writes a value
 * at a position. Where the location is already the position, nothing happens here. Where it is not —
 * a field every case of a sum spreads is readable on the sum and a row writes it under one case —
 * one line comes out as one line per case, on the same number and from the same rule, wherever this
 * reading got as far as those positions.
 *
 * <p><b>What comes out.</b> Every name a rule is written at is either left where the model wrote it
 * or filed at one or more positions. An end put on a number and a value singled out are about one
 * name, so they come out once at each position that name was filed at, and once as written where it
 * was filed nowhere. A line is about the names it is drawn between, so it takes one more question:
 * where none of them was filed the line stays where it was written, where one was it comes out once
 * at each position that one was filed at, and where more than one was, which of their positions go
 * together is not settled here and the line is not placed.
 *
 * <p>How many names were filed and how many positions one of them was filed at are separate
 * questions. Answered off one count, a name filed at one position and a name left where it was
 * written would be the same answer, and the second must leave the rule alone where the first must
 * not.
 *
 * <p><b>Before anything is matched against an axis.</b> What divides a position is settled by the
 * terms being the same term. Left to the matching, a line drawn on a name no axis carries would be a
 * line nothing divides — which reads as a comparison this compiler could not take in, and is a cause
 * nobody established.
