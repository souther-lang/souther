/**
 * The values of a plan where one position inside it holds a number the caller has.
 *
 * <p>What a walk filling a container to a total needs: each element is a whole value of its own
 * type with the number at the path the total reads, and everything beside it is chosen the way any
 * value of that type is.
 *
 * <p>A source of values and not a second reading of the plan. Which positions are under a position,
 * which case a value is narrowed to, what a container holds and which names a value still has to
 * wear are {@link ConstructionPlan}'s answers, read by {@link PlanComposer} for every caller —
 * walked here from the declarations instead, this agreed wherever the way down was records and lost
 * the value at every sum, newtype and container.
 *
 * <p>So what is left here is one question: where a record's fields come from. The one the caller's
 * number is under comes from below, and the rest are chosen against the record's own rules, read
 * again once the number is in them — so what is offered is a value the model may well admit rather
 * than a shape that carries the number and breaks a rule about the field next to it.
 *
 * @param fixed the position the number is written at, which is the one the plan was made against
 * @param value the number, as the position's own carrier writes it
