/**
 * One behavior's input as it was read, and where the model divides it.
 *
 * <p><b>One reading, and the geometry measured against it.</b> The walk a row's values are written
 * by and the orders its numbers are measured on both follow from one reading of one behavior's
 * declarations; where the values are divided does not — a body draws lines the declarations say
 * nothing about — so the classes come from a measurement made against that reading rather than from
 * the reading itself. Handed over as separate values, a caller could give a search the walk of one
 * reading and the orders of another, or classes measured against a third: two behaviors taking a
 * parameter spelled the same way is all it takes, and then a row is composed on one measurement's
 * orders and read back by another's walk. There is one value here, so there is nothing to put
 * together wrongly — and one place makes it, from one {@code (module, behavior)}.
 *
 * <p><b>What a reader gets is a projection of this and never its parts.</b> Placing a row's values
 * takes the walk and some of the classes, and looking for a row at a line takes the walk and that
 * line: both are the walk beside something measured, which is exactly the pairing above. So a
 * reader asks here for {@link MeasuredAxes} or a {@link BorderReading}, and neither can be made
 * anywhere else — the classes a projection holds are this measurement's own, and the geometry a
 * border reading holds is checked against this reading before it is one.
 *
 * <p><b>The reading itself does not come through.</b> What is offered is the two questions a search
 * asks — where a value is written, and what a number there is measured on — and not a way of asking
 * the reading anything else. A construction plan's coordinate is spelled with the same
 * {@link TermPath} as a position of the input, so a search that could reach the reading could look
 * one up in it and be told that a place it is building at is not a position of anything.
