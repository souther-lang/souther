 * is is the quantity's to read — it is the one thing that knows what it is a quantity of — and what
 * this adds is what belongs to the rows: which reading of a row a point is tried against, and that a
 * line a fork drew is met by getting the comparison to answer as well as by writing the value.
 *
 * <p>Asked of a tuple and not of a row, so that what is already written and what a generation has
 * just composed are put the same question. Written against a row, the question could only be asked
 * of what is in the file — and the second answer somebody wrote for a candidate would be this rule
 * again, free to agree with it until one of them moved.
 *
 * <p>Nothing here concludes anything about coverage. It says what these values do at this point; who
 * may act on that, and what a point nothing was seen at means, is the caller's.
