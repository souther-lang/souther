/**
 * Which of a rule's lines a line of the model is.
 *
 * <p>Three questions under one word until now, and each is answered by whatever decomposed the rule
 * rather than by a number a reader arrived at. A clause an author named is written in the parts they
 * joined, and the split that made those parts issues each one's name; a part of a behavior's clause
 * states as many things as the reading of it finds, and that reading issues each statement's name; a
 * rule written in a body is a rule apiece and is decomposed by nothing, so there is no name below the
 * rule for it to carry. Held as one number over all three, a reader was told which line without being
 * told which of the three counted it, and no two of those counts are the same fact.
 *
 * <p>So the answer says which it is, and the arm carrying a number carries the one that was issued
 * with it. Nothing here numbers anything: an arm assembled from a rule and a number a caller had
 * would be that caller's own count filed under whichever rule they were holding, which is what
 * naming the parts and naming the statements were each made to close.
