/**
 * The combinations a group of decisions has, as the classes a row filling one may sit in.
 *
 * <p>Two vocabularies meeting. A decision is read off the body and says which way a comparison came
 * out or which case a union was matched at; a row is written at classes of the input positions. The
 * two are about the same rules — the comparison a factor names is the comparison a cut was drawn
 * off — so this is a lookup rather than a second derivation of where the model divides.
 *
 * <p>A condition is a constraint and not a choice of class. {@code n > 10} leaves every class above
 * the line, and picking one of them here would answer for the condition alone and be wrong as soon
 * as a second one arrives: under {@code if n > 10 { if n > 0 { … } }} the way in is both, and a
 * reading that wrote a class down for each would keep the last. So a cell carries which classes each
 * position may hold, one condition narrows it, and a cell nothing is left at is not a combination.
 *
 * <p>A group is offered only where every condition it is made of narrows something. What a cell is
 * for is a row that takes the path to the meeting and settles each factor at the outcome the cell
 * names, and a condition with no classes to put a row at leaves both open: the row may go the other
 * way round the fork above, or take a different outcome of the factor, and either way it is offered
 * for a combination it does not sit in. A row already written reads the same way — the cell would be
 * taken for covered by a row that never reaches the operator. So the group goes, and what is left is
 * the pair space, which is where such a behavior already was.
 *
 * <p>A factor whose outcomes leave the same classes goes for the second half of the same reason: no
 * row can be steered from one to the other, so the cells over it are one row asked for several times.
