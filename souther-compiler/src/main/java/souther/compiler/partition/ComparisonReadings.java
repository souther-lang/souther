/**
 * One reading of a body's comparisons: where each stands, what its names point at, what a row had
 * already satisfied to get there, whether a line may be drawn on it, and what it came to where one
 * may.
 *
 * <p><b>Of the body the analysis reads, which is the tree the language's own operations stand
 * in.</b> A rule written over what such an operation answers is a rule of the model, and the tree
 * the backend emits from has the operation expanded into what it does — so a reading made there
 * met the comparison after the call was gone, while the rules about strings in the same body were
 * read where they stand. Two facts about one position came from two walks of two trees, and a
 * reader wanting both had to know which tree each came from.
 *
 * <p>Which leaves the comparisons inside such an operation out, and that is what it means to leave
 * them out: they are that operation's implementation, and a caller answers for the rules a caller
 * wrote. Where a run through a comparison is recorded is still the emitted tree's, and the two are
 * joined on the construct of the model they agree about
 * ({@link souther.compiler.types.ModelOccurrence}).
 *
 * <p><b>Each comparison is read once, here, and what it came to travels with it.</b> A reader that
 * reports why a comparison bears no line reads the answer off the standing and never reads the
 * arithmetic again: read again downstream, the second reading answers about the form when the
 * question was about where the comparison stands, and a form read to the end is described as one
 * nobody could read.
 *
 * <p><b>One walk, because there is one thing being walked.</b> Three facts about a comparison are
 * settled by where it stands in the body, and each was being worked out by a walk of its own: which
 * names are in force, whether what is computed there is read on the way to an answer, and what the
 * evaluation before it established. Two walks threading the same {@code let} rule through the same
 * tree are two chances to disagree about it, and a fact one of them learned to carry is one the
 * other still drops.
 *
 * <p><b>What stands when a comparison runs is a fact about the position, not about a condition.</b>
 * It was read off {@link Condition}, which is a reading of a subtree and so needs a root — and the
 * root anything ever gave it was a fork's condition. So {@code A && B} established nothing for
 * {@code B} while {@code if A then B else false} did, one model spelled two ways with two answers
 * about where a row for a border on {@code B} is looked for; a name standing for {@code A}
 * established nothing either, because a subtree read on its own has no reading of the names above
 * it. A walk of the body has no root to be given and reaches every position, so what a condition is
 * asked is what it can answer: what a subtree coming out one way establishes
 * ({@link ReachingCuts#stating}), and never where the comparisons are.
 *
 * <p>The two operators are where a walk of the body is not a walk of what runs. {@code &&} and
 * {@code ||} settle as soon as they can, so the right operand runs under what the left one coming
 * out its way established — which is the whole of what makes this per comparison rather than per
 * fork. Everything else evaluates its parts under what stood at it.
