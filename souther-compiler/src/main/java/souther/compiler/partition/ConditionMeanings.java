 * asked of whichever copy a reader happens to hold — the defect
 * {@code NothingThatWalksATreeNamesTheReadingOfTheInput} is written against. What moves along the
 * walk is the environment; this is made once beside it and asked.

 * is turned into what it states and where reaching an arm is turned into a narrowing; asked a second
 * way, a column of a decision table and a line drawn on the same comparison would be free to
 * disagree.
