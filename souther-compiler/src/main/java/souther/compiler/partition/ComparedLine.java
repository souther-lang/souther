/**
 * What one comparison says about a position, whoever wrote the comparison.
 *
 * <p>Which number a line can be drawn on, where it falls, and which side of it the value itself is
 * on are the same questions of a {@code guard} and of a comparison in an {@code ensures} — a rule is
 * read the same way wherever it is written (spec §boundary-coordinates). What differs is what
 * meeting the line takes, and that is the origin's to say rather than this one's.
 *
 * <p>The construction and not the entry. Each reader finds its own comparisons — one walks the
 * conditions of a body, the other the rules of a declaration — and the two have nothing to say to
 * each other about where to look.
 *
 * @param value  where the line falls on the order the number is counted on, which is not the order
 *               the position is written on wherever the number is taken of what stands there: a
 *               line at thirty minutes past the hour is at thirty, and what the position holds is a
 *               time
 * @param orders both of those, so that a reader writing a row knows what to write there and a
 *               reader placing a line knows what it is placed against
 *
 * @param claim  what the comparison placed on the values, carried as the classification the rule
 *               already has. An order says which side of the line the value it wrote belongs to and
 *               whether it holds there; a rule that names a value says the second and has no side
 *               to say — so opened into a boolean apiece, the second has to answer the first's
 *               question and what it answers is invented
