/**
 * What one comparison cuts, and where — the one place that decides it.
 *
 * <p><b>One decision, so that a rule is read the same way wherever it is written.</b> Which quantity
 * a comparison cuts was settled in three places, each reading a little more of the language than the
 * last and each turning the form round or not on its own: a rule written {@code 48 >= 3a + 6b} drew
 * its border on {@code -3a - 6b}, and the {@code ensures} side called two of the three readings and
 * so read no form at all. That is the shape this whole reading was written to stop, one level up
 * from where it was found.
 *
 * <p><b>The arithmetic first, and how it was written only where the arithmetic stopped.</b> The
 * canonical form says which quantity the rule cuts; what is left to decide is whether this compiler
 * can realize a line on the order that quantity is on. A reading of the operands is reached only
 * where the arithmetic had no answer at all — a date against a written date, a case of an
 * enumeration — so a spelling never settles a question the form has already settled. Tried first,
 * it did: {@code a <= a} came back a distance between two positions while the form had already
 * cancelled them, and the tautology was owed a row where the two hold one count.
 *
 * <p>Which levels the order has a place at is the order's own answer ({@link LevelSpace#canCutAt}).
 * Asked of the carrier instead — "do these values count" — two strings, which stand no measurable
 * distance apart and are still one above the other, were left with no line at the place they meet.
 *
 * @param of     what the rule cuts
 * @param at     where on it
 * @param claim  what the operator states about the threshold's own value
 * @param within what the rules leave the quantity itself. Three times a length is never negative,
 *               and a threshold outside where a quantity runs is one the rule draws no border at.
 *               Asked of every quantity alike, since what a quantity runs between is a question
 *               about the quantity
