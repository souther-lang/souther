/**
 * Whether the reading one measure of coverage depends on came to an end.
 *
 * <p>Two types and not one value shared between them, because the two measures are short of
 * different things. A rule whose line nothing could read leaves the border measure short while the
 * classes either side of it were read in full; a walk that never reached a position's rules leaves
 * both short. Written as one answer about the behavior, the first case reports the partition
 * measure on the strength of what stopped the other one — and the day a third measure arrives it
 * inherits whatever the two of them happened to share.
 *
 * <p><b>Closed is a conclusion, and only this class draws it.</b> Each {@code Closed} has a private
 * constructor and is reached through {@link #of}, which is handed the whole of what a behavior's
 * reading came to. Nowhere else is there a way to make one, so a caller holding one is holding the
 * proof that the reading ran out — the arrangement {@link UndividedPosition.Why.Absent} is under, at
 * the measure rather than at a position.
 *
 * <p><b>The questions first.</b> What a measure is mostly short of is a question the model raised
 * that nothing answered, filed under the measure that answers it
 * ({@link CoverageObligation#answeredBy}). Counted as "every reader ran to the end" instead, a
 * completeness says the model was read in full for exactly as long as nobody adds a reader.
 *
 * <p><b>And two facts no question carries.</b> A position whose rules were never enumerated
 * raises none, and a set of raised questions all answered is what a reading that never looked also
 * produces ({@link ReadingResidue}). And a rule the model wrote that this could not use is one
 * whose question a reading may well have answered before the position refused the answer — two
 * clauses placing ends on a {@code String}'s two coordinates are read, accounted for, and then
 * both dropped, and the accounting is right to say they were read. What an accounting cannot say
 * is that the measure was then left with nothing, and that is what this reads the refusals for.
 *
 * <p>Which measures each of the two costs is each one's own answer, and they do not agree. A
 * position whose rules were never enumerated and one the walk could not reach into leave both short,
 * because what is not known about them is not known for either. And a rule set aside answers
 * through its own reason ({@link souther.compiler.inputs.BlockReason.RuleWithoutLineReason#leavesShort}),
 * which for a comparison relating two positions is neither measure.
 *
 * <p><b>One stop, one gap, and the fold is on where the gap came from.</b> Two of the things a
 * reading can be short of are one stop said from two ends: the walk could not go into a position,
 * and so the rules it handed on reached nobody. The second is a consequence of the first, and the
 * arm that says so is what this reads to leave it out ({@link #derived}). Never the path — a
 * position the reading did enter and lost a clause of its own is an independent finding sitting at
 * the same place, and a fold on "there is already something here" takes that one with it (#1084).
 *
 * <p><b>And a question stands whatever else was found at its position.</b> A question comes off a
 * rule this compiler read and neither reader answered, so the rules a stop left unread raise none —
 * which means a suppression by position could only ever reach the real ones. What it did reach was a
 * rule about a {@code Map}'s size that nothing answered, dropped because the map's contents are out
 * of reach, which is a fact about other rules entirely.
 *
 * <p><b>A clause's question may stand and a comparison's may not.</b> A comparison raises a question
 * exactly where the reading of it reached a line, and that line answers it — both come off the one
 * reading, so a comparison either yields the question and its answer together or yields neither and
 * records what stopped it. So the way a comparison leaves a measure short is as a rule this reading
 * set aside, and never as a question nothing answered.
