 * <p><b>What a rule says, and not how it was written.</b> {@code a + 1 <= 10}, {@code 2 * a <= 10}
 * and {@code a <= b - 1} were each a comparison the measure could not read, because the readers
 * before this one wanted a bare position on one side and a written value or a bare position on the
 * other. What decides which quantity a rule cuts is this form and never the spelling, so
 * {@code a > b}, {@code a + 0 > b} and {@code a > b + 0} are one rule about one quantity.
 *
 * <p>The constant is moved to the threshold rather than kept in the quantity. {@code a + 1 <= 10} is
 * {@code a <= 9} and {@code 2 * a <= 9} is {@code 2 * a <= 9}, so a quantity is constant-free and a
 * threshold is a number. Left in the quantity, the values {@code 2 * a} takes would be the even
 * numbers under one spelling and the odd ones shifted by nine under another, and the two would
 * disagree about where the border's points are.
 *
 * <p>The arithmetic is {@link AffineForms}'s, which is the walk the discharge check reads a clause
 * with. The atoms are this side's: a position of a behavior's input, or a count taken of one.
