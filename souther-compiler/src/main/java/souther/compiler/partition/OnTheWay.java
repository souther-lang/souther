 * One condition on the way to a comparison, and what became of it.

 * <p>Both halves, because a region says nothing about how it was arrived at. What the walk took in
 * is what narrowed the search; what it could not take in is why the search may be looking over rows
 * that never arrive. Kept as one sequence in the order the walk met them, so that a reader asking
 * either question asks the same list — split into two at the seam, "nothing stood on the way" and
 * "everything on the way was taken in" come out as the same empty answer, which is the reading a
 * report cannot make and the one an author needs.
 *
 * <p><b>Every condition is one of these, and which is not a choice about the shape it was written
 * in.</b> A condition either lands in a vocabulary a search can compose against — the arithmetic's
 * ({@link TakenIn}) or the positions' ({@link Narrowed}) — or it is {@link Declined}. What a search
 * composes against is one list either way: which of the value vocabularies a condition landed in is
 * {@link TakenConstraint}'s answer and not a third arm here. So a fork this
 * reading learns to walk later widens what a search can reach and can never quietly leave a
 * condition off: a reader that cannot state one says so here, and a row composed under a declined
 * condition is a row that may not arrive rather than a row nothing knew about.
 *
 * <p>Collected where the condition is met and never worked out afterwards from where a comparison
 * sits, which is the rule {@link souther.compiler.reach.PathDecision} is written to as well.
