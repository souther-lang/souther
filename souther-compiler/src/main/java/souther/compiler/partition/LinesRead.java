/**
 * Every line one behavior's reading of the rules found, and every border it made of one.
 *
 * <p>Two records of one pass, kept apart so that neither is counted from the other. What a measure
 * is short of is what the model raised and nothing answered; that a measure may be called complete
 * at all is a separate claim — that the reading got to the end of what it was reading — and there is
 * nothing in the gaps to say it. A line dropped before it could be set aside leaves no gap behind,
 * so an empty account of what went missing is what a whole reading and a lossy one both produce.
 * That is issue #1079, and holding these two against each other is what refuses it.
 *
 * <p><b>Every producer, and not the two there are today.</b> A line that divides a position leaves
 * its border on the position ({@link Partitions#bordersOf}) and a line between two positions leaves
 * its border beside them ({@link Border#allOf}). They are the same reading and the same kind of
 * loss, and an accounting over one of them says nothing about the other — which is how a check
 * written for the first would have watched a {@code continue} go into the second.
 *
 * <p>Which is why the borders the reading hands back are held against this as well
 * ({@link #returning}). Kept by the producers alone, the account is worth what a producer
 * remembered to write in it, and a third one added later is off the books from the day it is
 * written — the same silence, one level up, and this whole arrangement is against exactly that.
 *
 * <p><b>Identity and not a count.</b> Two lines are one line where they are at one place and drawn
 * by one rule, which is what {@link Line} is. Counted instead, a reading that lost one line and made
 * another twice comes back whole; asked of the lines themselves, neither is possible.
 *
 * <p>Recorded where each thing happens: a line as the reading meets it, and a border where it lands
 * in what the reading returns. Recorded together, the two would agree by construction and the
 * account would prove nothing — what it is for is the day something is written between them.
