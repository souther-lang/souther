/**
 * The lines a declaration's clauses draw between two of a behavior's positions.
 *
 * <p>A rule relating two positions divides neither of them, and it is still a line: {@code lo <= hi}
 * says where the pair parts, and a row on it holds the two at one value. A body writing that rule
 * has it read as a line by {@link GuardThresholds}; a declaration writing it has an end on one
 * coordinate read out of it, which such a rule places none of, and this is where its line comes
 * from instead.
 *
 * <p><b>Read here in the vocabulary a line is drawn in, and not carried from the reading of ends.</b>
 * What a clause cuts is a question about numbers, and the two readings name numbers differently on
 * purpose: the discharge procedure names what it can carry a fact about, and this names the numbers
 * a behavior's positions hold. A rule over a number the first has no atom for — the days between two
 * dates — is one this reads to the end, so a clause set aside there is asked here rather than taken
 * as settled.
 *
 * <p>Only the lines that are on no position. A clause bounding one coordinate leaves an end, the end
 * becomes a cut of that position's axis, and the axis is where its line already is; drawn again here
 * it would be two lines where the author wrote one, and a row would be owed twice for one rule.
 *
 * <p>What such a line owes is not what a body's line owes, and that difference is why an author
 * writes the rule on the data. Nothing outside a declaration's rule can be constructed, so the far
 * side of its line holds no value and no row is asked for there. That answer is read off the rule
 * that drew the line ({@link LineOrigin.InvariantOrigin}) and is already right — what was missing was
 * the line.
