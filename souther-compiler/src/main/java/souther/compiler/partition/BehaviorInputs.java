/**
 * What a behavior takes: what its inputs are called, what they are declared to be, and what those
 * names denote.
 *
 * <p>One value because reading a row at a position needs all three. A path names a parameter and
 * the fields under it, a row's values arrive in the order the parameters are declared, and how a
 * value at a position is written — the names it wears — is what the declared types say. Given only
 * the first two, a reader walks a row by taking fields off values, which is right until a field
 * sits under a name.
 *
 * <p>And because the same three are what a row is generated from. Two spellings of what a behavior
 * takes are two chances to read a position differently, which is the shape of every defect this
 * package has been fixing: a {@link MeasuredInput} is these inputs and the axes derived at them,
 * both taken from the one reading they were made from.
 *
 * <p><b>The walk itself does not leave this package.</b> What a behavior takes can be said from a
 * signature and is a fact about the declaration, so this is built wherever that is what is wanted.
 * Walking a row with it is the other thing, and it is only ever right beside geometry measured
 * against the same reading — a walk from one reading and classes from another place a row in
 * classes nothing measured at the position it was read by. So {@link #valuesAt} and
 * {@link #occurrencesAt} are this package's, and a reader outside it asks whatever holds both.
