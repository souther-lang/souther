/**
 * A value written the way a row writes it — {@code Amount(0)}, {@code None}, {@code Overseas} — held
 * both as the text a person reads and as the tree a decoder builds.
 *
 * <p>Two forms of one value, because the two questions asked of it are different. What goes into a
 * generated row is text, and only text: the row is printed for someone to complete, so nothing about
 * it is a built object. Whether it can be built at all is a different question, and the only honest way
 * to answer it is to build it, which needs the tree. Deriving one from the other would mean either a
 * parser for the text or a printer for what a decoder saw, and both would be a second spelling of the
 * same value with its own way of disagreeing.
 *
 * <p>The tree carries what its names denote, because that is what a fixture is read by. A construction
 * is reached by the type it names, not by the spelling — so the type is put there when the value is
 * made, where it is known, rather than looked up again from the text.
 *
 * <p>Every name a value here wears arrives as a {@link TypeReachName}, so that the two forms are
 * written from one answer. What the tree denotes and what the text spells are the two halves of one
 * reference, and nothing here decides either: a type declared as {@code Amount} is written
 * {@code up.Amount} by a module that reached it through an alias, and a generator that spelled the
 * declaration's own name offered a row nobody could paste while handing the reader a name it
 * resolved to something else (issue #696).
