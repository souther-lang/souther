/**
 * Which expressions a fork's answer turns on, following only what the library says it does.
 *
 * <p>A rule written somewhere inside what a fork tests is a rule the fork tests only where the
 * value it decides reaches the fork's answer. {@code List.isEmpty(List.filter(p, xs))} turns on
 * what {@code p} answered — filtering answers fewer for exactly that reason — and
 * {@code List.isEmpty(List.map(p, xs))} does not: a mapping answers one per element whatever the
 * closure said, so what {@code p} decides is what the answers are and never how many.
 *
 * <p><b>Along declared edges and never down the tree.</b> The two calls above are the same shape,
 * so a walk that went wherever it could go would credit both alike — and a rule credited to a fork
 * it says nothing about is a fork this compiler did not read reported as one it did. What an
 * operation's answer turns on is a fact about the operation
 * ({@link souther.compiler.semantics.OperationFact.TurnsOnWhetherAnArgumentHolds}), so it is asked
 * there.
 *
 * <p><b>Stopping is the answer, not a gap.</b> An operation the library says nothing about is one
 * this cannot follow, and the walk ends. What that costs is a fork left stating a rule of its own,
 * which leaves the measure open; what following anyway would cost is a model nothing read reported
 * as read to the end, and the two are not the same kind of wrong.
