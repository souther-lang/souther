/**
 * What a clause of a behavior states outright, and which kind of rule each of those is.
 *
 * <p><b>Only what the rule requires.</b> A conjunct is part of what the rule asks of an answer, so
 * whatever it says the rule says; a disjunct is not — {@code id.value > 0 || id.flagged} is
 * satisfied wherever the other side is, whatever the comparison comes to. So the walk descends
 * through {@code &&} and through what a {@code let} binds, which is not a choice either, and stops
 * at everything else.
 *
 * <p><b>One descent, however many readers.</b> Two things are read off what a clause states — the
 * comparisons it draws lines with, and the predicates it tells sets of strings apart with — and each
 * walking the tree for itself would be the connective recognised twice, in two places free to come
 * to different answers about the same {@code &&} ({@link ConditionJoin}).
 *
 * <p><b>And one owner per statement.</b> Which of the readers a statement belongs to is settled here
 * too, and it is the same answer for everyone. Left to each reader, the question every reader asks
 * is "is this mine", and the only word a reader has for no is its own — so a rule read perfectly
 * well as a set of strings was also reported as a comparison whose form could not be read, and the
 * document said both about one thing the author wrote. Named here, "no reader reads this form" is
 * one arm that one reader answers for, and a reader's silence about a statement of another kind is
 * silence rather than a finding.
 *
 * <p>This is the shape the body already has. There a comparison is read where the catalog named one
 * ({@link ComparisonReadings}), so nothing hands a reader of comparisons an application to make what
 * it can of; here the clause is the catalog.
 *
 * <p><b>A choice is counted and states nothing.</b> Which statement of a clause a reading is
 * numbered by is what a reader is sent to, so the number may not move with what a reading managed —
 * an {@code ||} takes its place in the order and says neither of its sides. Left out, the statement
 * after it would be numbered as though it were written where the choice is.
