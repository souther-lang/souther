/**
 * One equivalence class of an input position: a set of values expected to behave the same way.
 *
 * <p>Three things are kept apart that a single "class" would run together — what the class means,
 * how a value is told to be in it, and whether one can be produced. A class whose representative
 * cannot be built is still a class: rows that reach it still count, and only the generator has to say
 * it cannot fill the gap.
 *
 * @param id              a name stable within its axis, used to compare one run against another
 * @param label           what to call it in a report
 * @param recognises      what the class means, which is what says whether a value the rows already
 *                        carry is in it. A value rather than a way of asking, so that a class can be
 *                        compared with another and kept in an answer
 * @param representatives how a value standing for it is arrived at
 * @param denotes         the values this class holds, where they can be written out, and null
 *                        where they cannot. A fourth thing, and separate from {@link #recognises}
 *                        for the reason the others are separate: a classifier answers about one
 *                        value, and a reader asking whether a rule refuses the whole class is
 *                        asking about all of them. A case holding a record has no end of values
 *                        and says nothing here; a case of an enumeration is one value and says so.
 *
 *                        <p>Null is "not written out here" and never "holds nothing" — a class
 *                        that holds nothing is not a class of the position, and what decides that
 *                        is the reading this is put to
 * @param selects         the narrowing a row sits in this class thereby meets, and null where
 *                        sitting in it narrows nothing. What tells a case of a sum from a value of
 *                        a range: a row in the {@code GlobalQuery} class of a position <em>is</em> a
 *                        {@code GlobalQuery} there, which is what the positions under that case
 *                        require of it.
 *
 *                        <p>Kept beside {@link #id} rather than recovered from it. The id is a name
 *                        for a report and is stable within its axis; which narrowing the class is
 *                        is what decides whether two classes can be in one row, and reading that
 *                        off a name is the same position answering differently depending on how it
 *                        was spelled
