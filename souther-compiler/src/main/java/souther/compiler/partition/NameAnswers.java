/**
 * What the reading of a body's names comes to, in the shape the walks over a body ask for.
 *
 * <p>Two walks meet every name of a body — the arithmetic that finds the line a rule draws, and the
 * one that says which positions a rule is about — and each asks its own interface for the same two
 * facts. What a name means is {@link InputReads#meaningOf}'s single answer; what is here is the
 * projection of that answer onto the pair those interfaces are written in.
 *
 * <p>Written once because the two walks disagreeing about a name is not a difference of opinion but
 * a defect with a shape: one of them reads a rule and draws its line while the other cannot name the
 * position the line divides, after which the position is reported as one the model divides no way.
 * Kept as two copies, that is one edit away at all times.
