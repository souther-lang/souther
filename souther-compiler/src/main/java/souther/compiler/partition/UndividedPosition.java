/**
 * A position no class came back for, and which of the three ways that happened.
 *
 * <p>The list of these used to be a list of paths, and everything downstream read a path in it as the
 * model having no distinction to draw there. A position whose rule is written in a form this does not
 * read is in that same list, and saying the same sentence about both tells an author to stop looking
 * for the line their own body draws.
 *
 * <p>So the absence is a value that has to be produced rather than the default reading of an empty
 * result. {@link Why.Absent} is produced by {@link PendingPosition#complete} and nowhere else, from
 * a position the reading got to the rules of, every question of which was answered, and which no
 * rule is filed at — which is what the word means.
 *
 * <p>The other two are the two ways of not being that, and they are opposite sentences about this
 * compiler. {@link Why.CannotDerive} says the readings did not get far enough for anything about
 * the model to follow; what leaves a position in that state is enumerated where the verdict is
 * made ({@link PendingPosition#complete}) and is not counted again here.
 * {@link Why.StatedWithoutALine} says the other thing — a rule is filed here and came to no line,
 * with nothing outstanding about it, so a reader sent after a limit would be looking for one that
 * is not there.
 *
 * <p><b>All three are a projection and none is a reading's own account of itself.</b> Whether a
 * question stands is asked of the accounting that holds every question a rule raises against
 * whatever answered it, so a reading short of a rule that another reading took in leaves nothing
 * standing. Read instead off what one reading was left with, a rule the reading of ends read from
 * end to end and the reading of values did not take in came out as a position nothing could read.
 *
 * @param at  the position, spelled the way a report names it
 * @param why whether the model draws nothing here, the readings did not get far enough to say, or
 *            a rule filed here came to no line
