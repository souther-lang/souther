/**
 * What a row has already had to satisfy by the time it arrives at one comparison.
 *
 * <p>The region a border a guard owes is searched in. A guard states a threshold and narrows no
 * declaration, so what the positions are declared to hold is the same everywhere in a body while
 * what actually arrives at a comparison deep in one is not — and a row for a border down there,
 * looked for over the declared domains, is looked for outside the region as readily as inside it.
 *
 * <p><b>Collected where the condition is assumed, and never worked out afterwards from where a
 * comparison sits.</b> A reading that walked back up the tree would be a second account of what was
 * assumed, free to name a condition nothing here could take in — and a region narrowed on a
 * condition nothing established is narrower than the rows that arrive, which is the one direction
 * that takes a coverage item away. So what is here is what the walk itself put in.
 *
 * <p><b>Including what it could not put in.</b> A condition the arithmetic has no word for narrows
 * nothing, and it is written down all the same: what a region is is one question and how it came to
 * be that region is another, and only the second can tell a search that ran over what the
 * declarations leave because nothing stood in the way from one that ran over the same box because a
 * guard above could not be read. Held as {@link OnTheWay}, so the two are one sequence in the order
 * the walk met them rather than a list and a silence.
 *
 * <p><b>Its own value and not its arm.</b> Under {@code A && B} the {@code then} arm is reached with
 * both holding, and the {@code else} arm with neither settled — a row can be in it for failing
 * either. Under {@code A || B} it is the other way round. Which of the two a comparison is in is
 * {@link GuardThresholds}'s reading of the condition, and taking an arm for a conjunct is how a
 * region would come to exclude rows that reach the guard.
 *
 * <p>Nothing here says a row that satisfies all of this arrives. A condition of a shape the
 * arithmetic cannot read is on the list without narrowing anything, so a region built from this
 * holds every row that arrives and may hold rows that do not — which is what {@link SearchRegion}
 * promises and what a proof of unreachability rests on. It is the inclusion and not a strict one:
 * a condition nothing took in may be implied by the ones that were, or hold of every row. Being on
 * the list is what lets a report say a condition is unaccounted for; it is not what the region is
 * built from.
