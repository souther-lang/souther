/**
 * The values a behavior's body compares its inputs against.
 *
 * <p>A model's own thresholds, read where they are written. "Pre-approval is needed at a hundred
 * thousand" is not in any type — it is the comparison the behavior makes — and it is the line the
 * rows have to be written on both sides of.
 *
 * <p><b>A comparison is read wherever in a condition it is written</b> (spec
 * §boundary-coordinates). Which position the model divides is not a question about the
 * shape of the condition around the comparison, and it was answered as though it were: in
 *
 * <pre>if kind == Domestic &amp;&amp; cost &lt;= 100000</pre>
 *
 * the line at a hundred thousand went unread, and the position came back as one the model divides
 * no way — two tokens from the comparison that divides it.
 *
 * <p>Whether a comparison ran is not something the arms answer. A condition stops as soon as it is
 * settled, so under {@code A && B} an overseas request takes the else arm without {@code cost} having
 * been compared — and so does a request whose cost was compared and found too high. Each comparison
 * carries the site its own value is recorded at, which is what a line is measured against, and the
 * arms of the fork standing round it are read for nothing.
 *
 * <p>Three readers are kept apart and are easy to run together. Which comparisons exist is
 * {@link souther.compiler.coverage.ComparisonCatalog}'s answer and which of them a line may be drawn
 * on is {@link BoundaryPolicy}'s; which positions a comparison names at all is
 * {@link #mentioned}; which number a line can be drawn on is {@link InputNumber}'s. The last is the
 * narrowest, and asking it the first two questions is how a position a body compares became a
 * position nothing compares.
