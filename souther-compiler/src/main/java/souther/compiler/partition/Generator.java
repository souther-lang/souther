/**

 * <p>The plan comes in and this composes for nothing of its own. Which class of which position no
 * row sits in, and which arm no row goes through, is what a measure reads off the rows and reports;
 * a search working either out again is a second reading of one fact, free to offer a row at a class
 * the report calls reached. A combination of the body's decisions is where a witness for an arm is
 * looked for and is not itself a thing anyone is owed a row at.
 *
 * <p>What comes out is everything it takes to run the row and nothing that says what should come of
 * it. The inputs, and what each dependency the behavior requires is stood in with; the expected
 * answer is left for a person, because the compiler does not know it — the whole point of a model
 * with no {@code let} is that the answer lives in a legacy system or in someone's head, and a
 * generator that guessed would turn a question into an assertion nobody made.
 *
 * <p>The stand-ins are on a candidate from the moment it is composed. What a row does is what it
 * does in some environment, so a candidate run in one environment and published in another is a row
 * certified for a line nobody is offered — and completing a row downstream is how the two came
 * apart.
 *
 * <p>What it reports is not only the rows. Everything on the plan gets an entry saying what came of
 * it, with which of {@link UnresolvedCombination.Reason} it was — the list is that enum's to keep,
 * and naming it here would be a second copy going stale. A generator that returned only the rows it
 * managed would read as though the rest were covered, and one that gave the same answer to every kind
 * would send an author looking for a value that does not exist while a row they could write in a line
 * went unwritten.

     * the model's own constructor over the whole input, so a field's value can be refused for what
     * another field was given. The unit being tried is the tuple, not the value — walking one index
     * across every position at once tries the diagonal of the choices and misses the rest, and two
     * fields whose rules are the same but written in a different order then land on different indices
     * and never meet.
     *
     * <p>So the assignments are walked outward from the one where every position takes its first
     * value: then the ones a single position has moved one step from, then two, and so on. Nearest
     * first, because a position's first value is the one that stands for it, and a row that took a
     * later one at every position is a row further from what the model says it is about. The walk
     * stops at {@link #MAX_TUPLES}, and stopping is reported as having stopped rather than as
     * everything having been refused.
     *
     * <p>The parameters {@code given} names are written as it says instead of composed, which is
     * what makes a value the model already states an origin of the search rather than a
     * rewrite of its answer. Composed first and rewritten after, a row the baseline could have been
     * written for came back as one nothing composed — a representative chosen from the classes
     * alone breaks a rule relating two positions while the model's own value does not — and a row
     * the baseline needed nothing beside came back carrying whatever the composition had needed.
     *
     * <p>{@code answers} is what the row stands its target's dependencies in with, which is the
     * same for every row of one behavior here: what a class or an arm asks about is the positions,
     * and nothing on that route asks a dependency for one answer over another. It is carried in
     * rather than put on afterwards because a row without it is a row nothing applies, and a
     * candidate the search ran in one environment and published in another was certified for a row
     * nobody is offered.
