/**
 * What tells one thing a row is owed for from every other, over the derivations that state such
 * things.
 *
 * <p>Closed, so that a surface writing one writes every shape there is: a derivation added arrives
 * at each of them as a case to decide about rather than as a value that falls through. What the
 * shapes have in common is what they are for and not what they hold — a line's point is a point of
 * an authored line at a level, an arm's is the fork and which of its ways, a class's is the axis and
 * which class of it, a decision rule's is what the path consulted — so there is nothing here to lift
 * out of them.
 *
 * <p><b>Not a handle a search steers by.</b> What a proposal targets is one of these; how a search
 * reaches it is the search's own — {@link Generator.ArmOwed} names an occurrence a run is recorded
 * at, and what a requirement search came back standing at is values. Held as one value, a proposal
 * merged with another because their stimuli agreed would lose which obligations it was for, and the
 * account would be keyed on whatever the search happened to name.
 *
 * <p>Below the account rather than in it. The generator, the readings and the account all join on
 * this, and the two of them that cannot see the account would each have had a vocabulary of their
 * own — which is the parallel bookkeeping this is here to have none of.
