/**
 * What the rules about one position divide it into, in the one vocabulary they can all be said in.
 *
 * <p><b>The question is the vocabulary, and not which kind of evidence arrived.</b> A position is
 * divided by everything the model says about it, and what this decides is whether all of that can be
 * said as one exclusive and exhaustive list of classes. Branching instead on which kind of rule was
 * met, a position reached by two kinds had the classes of whichever kind the branch happened to
 * name, and the other kind's distinctions went missing from the denominator with nothing said.
 *
 * <p><b>Two vocabularies today.</b> A rule can put a line on the order the values are counted on, or
 * tell a set of them from the rest. Both divide a position and neither is the other: a run of values
 * has a least and a next, and a set has neither, so a class in one of them cannot be written in the
 * other. A position reached by both is one this compiler has no single list of classes for, and it
 * comes back saying so rather than divided by the half that happened to be expressible.
 *
 * <p><b>Nothing else is lost by that.</b> Where the classes are not composed, the cuts a line drew
 * and the places the rules part the position are still what they were — they are separate
 * observations about the position and not a projection of the classes. What goes is the denominator,
 * which is the thing that would have been wrong.
 *
 * <p>And a class exists because the model divides the position, never because a value can be written
 * into a row for it. A class nobody can compose a value for says that about itself; dropped instead,
 * the denominator a build is measured against would follow what this compiler can generate.
