 * distinctions a rule turns on, where a fact given up is a column the table admits it cannot say
 * the meaning of. The two questions have different right answers about one condition — a truth
 * narrows no region and is a distinction all the same — so they are asked apart, and what a
 * comparison over the input states is asked of the arithmetic rather than read a second way here.
 *
 * <p>Both halves come back together. A column is what tells one rule from another, and what the
 * same condition states about the input is what a search composes a row against; a reader holding
 * one without the other would have to pair them again from the order two walks happened to answer
 * in.
