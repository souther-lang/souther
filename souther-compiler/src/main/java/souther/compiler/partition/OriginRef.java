/**
 * A rule of the model, as a boundary reader met it.
 *
 * <p>{@link RuleRef} and what is true of it here. Which rule it is is the same value however many
 * times the rule is read, and everything beside it on these records is an answer about this reading
 * of it: where the comparison's own value is recorded, which arms witness it, which side of the
 * line the cut value falls on, which declarations took an end in. None of those tell one rule from
 * another, and a question keyed on them is a question the reading raised rather than the model.
 *
 * <p>Four identities and not one, because they are four equivalences. {@link RuleRef} answers whose
 * rule it is; {@link AuthoredLine} answers which of that rule's lines was drawn; this answers which
 * reading of that line a boundary was drawn off; and {@link BoundaryLine} answers which of them a
 * partition folds into one. A guard inside a helper is read once per call: those are several of
 * these, one {@code RuleRef}, one authored line, and one line.
 *
 * <p>Kept per cut rather than per axis. Several rules can put a cut at the same value — a type's
 * invariant and a {@code guard} that repeats it, or two guards written in different behaviors — and
 * they merge into one partition while staying separate obligations. Reaching the boundary through one
 * guard says nothing about the other.
