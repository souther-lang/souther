/**
 * Containers filled so that the occurrences of a path inside them come to a number.
 *
 * <p><b>One question, and the two ways a total is written are cases of it.</b> A total of a list at
 * a position adds up what the list holds, and a total over a run adds up what stands at a path
 * inside each element — the container is the same thing either way, and what differs is how far
 * down the number is. Written as two, the second would be the first's algorithm with an extra step,
 * free to disagree with it about how many elements a total is worth.
 *
 * <p><b>The elements are chosen against what the rules leave them.</b> How many the container may
 * hold is what its own type declares and what the record holding it says, tightened together; what
 * one occurrence may be is what the region leaves the number at that path. A container built without
 * asking either is one the decoder refuses, and the point it was built for then reads as an edge
 * every value was refused at rather than as one this did not fill.
 *
 * <p><b>And a range is not an existence proof.</b> That {@code k} elements between {@code lo} and
 * {@code hi} could reach the total is arithmetic on the ends, and the values between them are the
 * carrier's rather than every number in the interval. So a count the ends admit is a count to try,
 * and one whose decomposition does not land on the carrier is stepped over — the next count up is
 * asked the same question. Read as a proof, the first hole in an order would be a total nothing
 * composes a row for.
 *
 * <p>Nothing here decides whether the model admits what was built. Every element is a whole value
 * composed under its own type's rules, and the row it goes into is put through the module's own
 * decoder like any other — which is what makes the offer a row rather than a shape carrying a
 * number.
