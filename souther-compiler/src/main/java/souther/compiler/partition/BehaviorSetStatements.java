/**
 * What a behavior's rules about the strings at its positions state of those positions.
 *
 * <p>The one crossing from a plan to a set on this side. What a reading hands on is the rule and the
 * strings it names; what a partition works with is the values on either side of it, and turning the
 * first into the second is making a machine. Done anywhere a reader felt like it, the machine would
 * be built under whatever allowance that reader happened to hold, and the same rule would come to a
 * different set depending on who asked.
 *
 * <p><b>Stating and dividing are two answers.</b> A rule states a set of the position's values and
 * the rest; whether the position holds values on both sides of that is a fact about the position,
 * settled where its values are known ({@link Classing}). So nothing here says a position was
 * divided — what leaves is what the rules state, and every reader of it is one that has the
 * position's own values in hand.
 *
 * <p><b>One rule at a time, and what a position comes to is not asked here.</b> What several rules
 * leave a position between them is a question about every rule that reached it, and the rules of a
 * behavior's body are not all of them — a value singled out by a comparison divides the same
 * position. Answered here, the denominator would be completed by the reader that can see least of
 * it, out of the rules it happened to read.
 *
 * <p><b>The position is still the unit of what is built.</b> Both sides of every rule of a position
 * go to the allowance as one group, so which of them a reader hears about does not follow the order
 * they were walked in ({@link Allowance#realizeAll}).
 *
 * <p><b>Both sides are asked for, and neither is derived from the other.</b> The values a rule does
 * not admit are a plan like the values it does ({@link PatternPlan#notMatching}), so they are built
 * where everything else is and are charged for there. Left to a caller, the complement would be the
 * one expensive operation done outside the arrangement that exists to bound it.
 *
 * <p><b>On its own allowance, and not the one a declaration's answer draws on.</b> What a behavior
 * tells apart is not a projection of what a position admits: a position whose own answer stopped
 * short still has its body's rules read here, and raising what a declaration may build must not make
 * a class appear ({@link AdequacyPolicy.OfTheMeasures#allowanceForBehaviorDistinctions}).
 *
 * <p>And every rule handed in comes back as exactly one outcome ({@link Outcome}), which is a
 * classification and not what a walk had left over: it states a distinction of a position, or one
 * this compiler did not get, or nothing about any position it can name.
 *
 * <p>The last of those leaves without a sentence, and that is the one thing here nobody is told.
 * A rule about a value that came from no position the reading can name has nowhere to be shown —
 * the same answer the reading of a comparison gives the same shape — so what is claimed is that
 * every rule is classified, and not that every rule is reported.
