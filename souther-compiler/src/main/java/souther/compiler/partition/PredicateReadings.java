/**
 * One reading of the predicates a body applies to the strings at its positions.
 *
 * <p><b>Of the body the analysis reads</b> ({@link AnalysisBody}), which is the tree such a rule is
 * in. {@code String.startsWith(p, code)} is one of the language's own operations, and the tree a
 * backend emits has it expanded into the walk it turns into — read there, a body full of rules about
 * its strings holds none. So this takes the representation where the operation stands and reads it
 * as what it states.
 *
 * <p><b>Beside {@link ComparisonReadings} and not inside it.</b> Both read the tree the language's
 * operations stand in; what differs is the authority. A comparison puts a line on the order the
 * values at a position are counted on, and a predicate tells a set of them from the rest — two
 * questions with two answers, and a walk that asked them together would be one reader deciding
 * which of the two a rule is by looking at what it turned out to do.
 *
 * <p>This said the two read two trees, which is what they used to do: a rule stated as one of the
 * language's own operations was read where those stand and a comparison where they are expanded.
 * A comparison is read where they stand now, so the difference between the two readers is the
 * question and not the representation.
 *
 * <p><b>What a rule means and what it does to a position are still apart.</b> This says which
 * predicate was applied, which strings it states and what the subject is. Whether that restricts the
 * position or divides it turns on where the rule is written, and a rule in a body divides — so the
 * division is worked out where every rule reaching a position is held together, out of the sets this
 * left.
 *
 * <p><b>A rule nothing reads is no rule.</b> A predicate bound to a name the body never reads states
 * nothing about what the behavior answers, and a class divided off a position by it would be one no
 * value of the model is ever on either side of. So a reading is made only where what is computed is
 * read on the way to the answer, which is the one thing carried down this walk.
