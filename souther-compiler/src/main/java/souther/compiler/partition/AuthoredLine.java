/**
 * One line of the model: which rule, and which of that rule's lines.
 *
 * <p>What the author wrote, with nothing about the reading that reached it. A rule is read once per
 * position of every behavior carrying it and once per call of every helper holding it; which
 * position, and which call of which helper, are {@link OriginRef}'s, and this is what several
 * readings of one line share.
 *
 * <p><b>How far that reaches is the rule's own answer and is not restated here.</b> {@link RuleRef}
 * is what a rule is, and it does not tell every kind of rule apart the same way: a clause of a
 * {@code data} is the type's rule wherever the type is carried, and a comparison and an
 * {@code ensures} clause are written in a body and are that behavior's — so a helper's comparison
 * called from two behaviors is two rules and two lines, while a type's clause read in two behaviors
 * is one. Said again here as "no behavior", this would be a second answer to a question the rule
 * already answers, and the two would differ for whichever kind of rule was added next.
 *
 * <p><b>Not the rule alone.</b> One clause places as many lines as it has conjuncts with an end in
 * them: {@code invariant within = value >= 1 && value <= 10} is one {@link RuleRef.Invariant} and
 * two lines, and a row at the bottom of the range is no evidence about the top. So which conjunct
 * drew it is part of this, and it is the clause's own text rather than the number it was written
 * about ({@link souther.compiler.check.DeclaredBounds.Drawn}).
 *
 * <p><b>And what the line is.</b> Two lines of one rule at one value are told apart by what each
 * says about its own value ({@link LineFacts}) — {@code value >= 5 && value <= 5} places a minimum
 * and a maximum at 5, and they are two lines however few values are left between them. Whether some
 * row could show the two apart is not asked: what row is left over is a fact about every other rule
 * of the model, so an identity read off it would be worked back out of what the rules happened to
 * leave rather than read from what this rule says.
 *
 * @param rule           which rule of the model drew it
 * @param conjunct       which of that rule's lines this is, counted over the conjuncts the author
 *                       wrote. Zero for a rule that draws one line, which is what a comparison and
 *                       an {@code ensures} clause each do
 * @param facts          what the rule says about its own line
 * @param narrowedWithin the declarations that took a bound's end in, kept so that a narrowed line
 *                       stays apart from the bare one it narrows: {@code MinuteOfDay}'s maximum is
 *                       the same rule whether or not {@code WorkInterval} moved where it lands, and
 *                       the line the two settled together is not the line the bound would have
 *                       drawn alone. These are also who owes the line, which the bound is not once
 *                       something took its end in ({@link #obligationOwners})
