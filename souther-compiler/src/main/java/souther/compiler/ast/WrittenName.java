/**
 * A name, and the occurrence of it in the source that this one came from.
 *
 * <p>These are two questions with two answers, and a name is asked both. Which name is it — the one
 * a declaration and a reference have to agree on, the one a wire tag is written from, the one a
 * {@code --behavior} argument is matched against — is {@link #canonical()}, and canonically
 * equivalent spellings give one answer because they are one text (ADR-0095). Where is it written —
 * what a report underlines, what a rename rewrites, what a cursor is on — is {@link #segments()}.
 *
 * <p>The two travel together because the second cannot be recovered from the first. Reading a width
 * off the canonical name puts every range short by however many combining marks the author typed,
 * and the failure is invisible until someone writes one: the underline stops mid-name, a rename
 * leaves the marks behind, a cursor on the last character is answered about nothing. Any caller
 * holding a name and a position as two values is a caller that can pair a name with somewhere it is
 * not written, so there is no form here that takes them apart.
 *
 * <p>The place is <b>the tokens</b> and not the stretch of file they lie in. A qualified name is read
 * over meaningful tokens, so {@code up . Amount} is one name and so is one a comment carries over a
 * line break — and the whitespace, the dots and the comment between the parts are not the name. Two
 * questions want two answers here as well, and this is the second pair the design got wrong:
 * {@link #region()} is what a report underlines, one continuous stretch, comment and all, because an
 * underline with holes in it is not something to read. {@link #covers} is whether a cursor is on the
 * name, and it is on it only where a token is. Answering the second with the first put
 * go-to-definition and rename under the cursor in the middle of a comment.
 *
 * <p>{@link #spelling()} is what a report quotes: the parts joined by dots, which is the name as its
 * author means it whatever sits between them. It is a claim about the name and not about the file.
 *
 * <p>A name no one wrote — one a desugaring minted, one a pass synthesized — is {@link #synthetic}:
 * it has a canonical form and somewhere to complain at, and no spelling, because there is no place
 * in the source where those characters are.
 *
 * <p>{@code anchor} is that somewhere, and it is a point rather than a stretch. Where a name is
 * written the stretch is read off the tokens; where no one wrote it there is no stretch to read, and
 * the only honest width is none. Taking the canonical name's length from the anchor — which is what
 * this did — states in characters of the file a fact about the name, and the two are the same number
 * only until an author writes a combining mark or a lowering picks a name longer than the form it
 * replaced.
