/**
 * The abstract syntax: a module as the characters that spell it were read, with every name still a
 * spelling and nothing yet settled about what it denotes.
 *
 * <p>Every form here is one the frontend writes, and that is what this is — not {@link Hir} with
 * the resolution taken out. A form that comes into being further down belongs to the
 * representation whose pass makes it: a codec is derived from a data's shape, an expansion is
 * written where a call is inlined, and neither has a twin up here for nothing to build. A twin
 * would be a form no parse answers with, held to every rule the reachable frontend is held to,
 * with a reader taking it for something the language can be written in.
 *
 * <p>What the frontend writes is not the same as what an author wrote. A unit data a construction
 * implied, a binder for a name the source never spelled, the {@code Option<T>} a {@code T?} became
 * — all of them are written here, by the pass that reads the concrete syntax. What may not be
 * written here is a form that pass never answers with, and
 * {@code TheParsedTreeHoldsOnlyWhatTheFrontendWritesTest} asks of each of these forms whether it
 * is one.
 *
 * <p>The same holds of a form's parts. A component a parse cannot decide reads as a distinction the
 * tree draws, and offers a pass below an answer to take — one that says the same thing wherever it
 * is asked, since that is all a parse can put there. Where a construction came from is the one that
 * was here; {@code TheParsedTreeDoesNotSayWhereAConstructionCameFromTest} is what says it is not.
