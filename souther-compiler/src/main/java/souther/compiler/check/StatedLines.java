/**
 * What one leaf states, and on which of a value's numbers.
 *
 * <p>What a leaf states is one answer, and it is the same answer wherever the leaf is written. The
 * reading of ends composes the connectives an author wrote and has no arithmetic for the sides of a
 * comparison: it can say it did not work a line out and cannot say whether there was one to work
 * out. So a rule holding every row there is, one restricting which values may stand somewhere, and
 * one bounding a number an operation answers all read alike there — as rules whose end nobody
 * worked out — and under a choice that is what they were published as.
 *
 * <p>They are told apart here, by the reading that has the arithmetic, and told apart the way the
 * attribution of an end to a conjunct already tells them apart: by the numbers the canonical form
 * of the comparison is over. Read off which side happens to be spelled as a name, a rule whose
 * coordinate is written inside an expression — {@code String.length(s) * 2 >= 4} — is a rule about
 * nothing, and under a choice that comes back as a model that draws no line.
 *
 * <p><b>What a leaf states, and never what became of it.</b> Whether a range was read for the line
 * is the reading that holds that order's answer, and this hands its own out so that the two can be
 * put together where both are in hand ({@link #waitingOnAReader}). Decided here, a leaf would be
 * classified by what some reader managed with it, which is the confusion the whole type is against.
