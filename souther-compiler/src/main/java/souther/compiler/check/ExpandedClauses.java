/**
 * One declaration's invariant clauses with everything its own module defines substituted, and the
 * operations the language defines left standing ({@link InliningPolicy#DISCHARGE}).
 *
 * <p>That is the whole of what this value says, and it is a property of the tree rather than of who
 * reads it. Two readers already take this form — the invariant-discharge analysis and the codec's
 * constraint mapping — so a name taken from either would be the other's to misread, and a third
 * reader would arrive at a name that was never about it.
 *
 * <p><b>Whose it is.</b> The clauses of a declaration, worked out in the environment of the module
 * that wrote it. Nothing about it depends on who is asking: a module that imports the declaration
 * has no substitution of its own to make, and could not make this one — what a clause names may be
 * a definition its declaring module never exposed, which no importer has a name for
 * (spec §invariant-discharge-representation).
 *
 * <p><b>Why this is not a record.</b> A record's canonical constructor is as public as the record,
 * and what this carries is a list of clauses that anything could supply — which is the whole of what
 * the written tree is too. A reader handed a bare list has nothing to tell the two apart, and that is
 * how a declaration came to be read in whichever representation the reader happened to hold. So the
 * value is minted where it is made and nowhere else: {@link ClauseHelpers} performs the expansion and
 * is the one production site, the way {@link souther.compiler.types.TypeSymbol.AtModule} is minted
 * only by {@code TypeSymbols}.
