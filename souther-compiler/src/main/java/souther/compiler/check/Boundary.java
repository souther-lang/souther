/**
 * How the alternatives a value can be are written at a boundary: which form the set travels as, what
 * tag each alternative wears, and — where the form has one — the key that tag stands under.
 *
 * <p>A named sum and a behavior's output union are one question asked of two spellings. Both are a
 * set of alternatives that has to cross, and both are answered here through the same call, so
 * neither can be given a form, a tag or a key the other was not. They used to be answered in five
 * places that read none of the others, and two of them disagreeing went unreported because every one
 * of them dispatches on the first alternative that answers (#990, #994).
 *
 * <p>Nothing of this is stored. The representation is derived (ADR-0004) and a declaration says
 * nothing about it, so a field on {@link Hir.SumData} holding it would be an answer that can drift
 * from the one a reader works out — and a union, which has no declaration to hold a field, could not
 * be given one at all. That is what made the union a separate path in the first place.
 *
 * <p>The boundary here is where a value crosses into or out of the program, which is what
 * {@link BoundaryInput} and {@link BoundaryOutput} are about. It is not the boundary of
 * {@code query.BoundaryDerivation} and {@code partition.BoundaryPolicy}, which is the line a rule
 * draws between two classes of input. The two never meet: this answers how a value is written, and
 * that one answers where a rule divides. Said because the word carries both in this compiler and a
 * reader arriving at one from the other has to be told which.
 *
 * <p>What is <em>not</em> here: which atoms there are, which is {@link AtomSpace}'s and is read from
 * it; what a case carries and therefore whether the tag can sit beside it, which is
 * {@link TypeOps#caseShape}'s; and whether a named sum is an enumeration in the language's sense,
 * which is {@link TypeOps#isUnitOnlySum}'s and is read by what counts a type's values and by what
 * orders them. Those are different questions about the same declarations, and folding them in here
 * would make one answer decide three things.
