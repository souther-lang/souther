/**
 * Where a value is, as the thing itself rather than as the text that named it: the binding it is
 * rooted at, and the fields read from there.
 *
 * <p>What a fact is about. Two facts are about one value when they are about one of these, and that
 * is decided by the binding a name was answered with — not by the name. A body may bind {@code a}
 * twice and mean two values; an expansion may write one body into another and carry a spelling that
 * means something else where it landed. Neither is a question the text can answer, and both are
 * settled here by construction, because a second binding is a second {@link BindingId} and the two
 * are simply different locations.
 *
 * <p>So nothing has to be forgotten when a name is bound again. A fact about the old binding stays
 * true of the old binding, and nothing reads it under the new one — where reading the key's text and
 * dropping every fact that mentioned the name was the alternative, which drops facts that merely read
 * like they mention it.
 *
 * <p>Which fields are steps is decided from what each is read from and not from how it is spelled
 * ({@link #isStep}), so two types that both declare {@code value} keep their locations apart.
