/**
 * How many values a declaration has, given how many the declarations it reaches have.
 *
 * <p>One step and not the answer. What every type has is settled by rising from "nothing shown" until
 * nothing moves, and this is the step that rises: handed what is known so far, it says what this one
 * declaration comes to. Kept apart from the rising so that a wrong answer is one or the other and
 * never both at once.
 *
 * <p>Every arm is an upper bound, and the one an arm may not reach for is a count of none without a
 * proof — {@link Cardinality} makes that unwritable, so the places below that name an
 * {@link Emptiness} are the whole list of ways a type comes to have none. A shape this does not decide
 * — a name that resolved to nothing, a type standing for another, a case nothing answered, a form
 * written for expressions and never for a field — answers {@link Cardinality#UNKNOWN}, because
 * refusing a declaration is what a count of none does and a shape nobody read is no reason to refuse
 * anything. The switch over types carries no {@code default} for the same reason: a form added later
 * stops the build here rather than being swallowed into whichever answer this one happened to give.
 *
 * <p>Where a declaration is shown to have none in more than one way at once, the proof it carries is
 * the nearest one and not the first one reached. Rules of its own before a position's own shape, and
 * a position's own shape before something another declaration lacks; among positions equally near,
 * the order they are declared in. So the same model gives the same proof however the reading is
 * arranged, which is what makes a refusal reproducible.
 *
 * <p>A position is read where it sits. The rules a record wrote about a field reach the value
 * standing there and are read at that field's own path, which is what makes a list holding at least
 * one a different question from the same list holding none. A value a collection holds is not that
 * position — nothing was written about it there — so the reading is put down at a collection's
 * element and the element is asked about its type alone. What that loses is precision: rules do reach
 * an element, and taking the type's answer gives a collection more distinct values to draw on than it
 * has, which admits where a narrower reading would refuse.
