/**
 * What a value of one type guarantees of itself, by the path under it each bound is about.
 *
 * <p>True of every value of the type and of nothing narrower. Nothing about where the value came
 * from, which case it turned out to be, or what a caller has taken in about it reaches here — so a
 * reader standing anywhere at all may assume these, and a reader that walks values it cannot name
 * one at a time has nothing else it may assume.
 *
 * <p>Three readers ask it, and one question is what makes them agree. The discharge check asks it of
 * a container's elements and of a parameter a walk's step is handed; the reading that measures a
 * model asks it of the values a run walks. Each of them is standing somewhere different and none of
 * them may condition the answer on where.
 *
 * <p><b>All of a value's owners or none.</b> Which clauses hold of a value of a type is
 * {@link ValueReading}'s answer, and a type with more than one owner is one whose cases each own
 * part of what a value of it is. A bound read off some of them is a bound half the values may be
 * outside, so a reading that falls over anywhere answers nothing — which leaves the value unbounded
 * rather than bounded by half of what the declarations say.
 *
 * <p><b>And a bound written on a case is not one of these.</b> Two cases can bound one shared field
 * differently, and what holds of a value that is one of them is neither. Nothing here joins them:
 * what is read is what each owner's own reading records at a path, and a name every case spreads
 * reads alike under each of them because the clauses of a shared part are what that part writes. So
 * a bound the cases disagree on is a bound this does not have, and a bound the value's own type
 * carries is one it does.
