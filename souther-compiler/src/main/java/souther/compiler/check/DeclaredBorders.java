/**
 * The lines one declaration draws, in the terms the declaration writes them.
 *
 * <p>What a report calls a line where it prints it under the declaration rather than under a
 * behavior. {@code UserId}'s clause draws {@code String.length(value) = 1}; the behaviors carrying
 * the type meet that line at {@code String.length(draft.owner)} and at
 * {@code String.length(activities[*]@CallTask.owner)}, and neither of those is what the author
 * wrote. A debt named after one of them would be named after whichever reading a report happened to
 * reach first (issue #1062).
 *
 * <p><b>Asked of the declaration, rather than carried from the readings.</b> Which number a clause
 * bounds is read from whatever value the reading started at — {@code Day}'s clause is about
 * {@code value} read from {@code Day} and about {@code d} read from the {@code Span} holding it —
 * so a coordinate that travelled here with a measurement would be one frame of several and nothing
 * would say which. Read from the declaration, there is one frame and it is the author's.
 *
 * <p>Where the declaration is written is read here too, because a report sends a reader to it and
 * a caller that looked it up separately would have a second way of finding one declaration — and a
 * policy of its own for the one that came back empty, which is a null place reaching a reader as a
 * switch over the arms a citation has.
 *
 * <p>Nothing here is an identity. What tells one authored line from another is the clause and which
 * of its conjuncts drew the end ({@link souther.compiler.partition.AuthoredLine}), and that is what
 * this is keyed by; what it hands back is what to call the line. Held as part of the identity,
 * the frames above would make one line two.
