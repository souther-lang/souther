/**
 * What one binding of the declarations came to: every fact about the language's operations, held to
 * a library, keyed by the operation each is about.
 *
 * <p>The one place a fact is looked up. The declarations ({@link
 * souther.compiler.semantics.OperationFacts}) publish a list and no index, so that a reader cannot
 * reach a fact except through what the binder made of it; this is what the binder makes, and a
 * reader that wants a fact asks here. Every value here is a {@link BoundOperationFact}, in which
 * every operation and every argument has already been read against its declaration, so what a
 * reader does with one is use it.
 *
 * <p><b>Keyed by the fact's own operation, and by a name.</b> The key under which a fact is filed is
 * read off the fact — {@code fact.operation().operation()} — and never written beside it, so no key
 * can say the fact is about one operation while the fact says another. And it is the name, because
 * that is the identity of a declaration ({@link souther.compiler.core.DeclaredOperation#equals}) and
 * because a reader holding a call the language resolved but did not keep standing has the name and
 * nothing else. Asking by name is a lookup among values the binding made and not a second reading of
 * the authored word: nothing here reads a declaration, a signature, or an {@link
 * souther.compiler.semantics.ArgumentRef}, and nothing here can be answered for an operation the
 * binding did not hold.
 *
 * <p><b>Bound to bound, and nothing else.</b> The two answers here that are not a plain lookup —
 * what an operation takes of its argument, which operations answer a number taken of one — are put
 * together from bound facts and the derivation those facts carry themselves
 * ({@link BoundOperationFact.AccumulatesItsContainer#takenAs}). No library and no authoring
 * vocabulary is read to answer them, so what they say cannot come apart from what was held.
 *
 * <p>Collected by family. A {@link BoundOperationFact.OneAboutAnOperation} is filed under its
 * operation once and a second of the same kind is refused: it would be two answers to a question
 * that has one, and a map written into keeps whichever arrived last. A
 * {@link BoundOperationFact.SeveralAboutAnOperation} is appended, in the order declared. Which of
 * the two a kind is was chosen where the arm was written, so nothing here has to be told.
 *
 * <p>Filed once, at construction, into what each query answers with. A query is asked per
 * expression per pass, so what it hands back is the list that was filed and not a projection made
 * for the ask.
