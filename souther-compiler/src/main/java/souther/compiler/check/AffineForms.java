/**
 * Reading an expression as {@code const + Σ coef·atom}, over whatever a caller counts as an atom.
 *
 * <p>One walk over one grammar. The check reads a clause this way to discharge it, and the measure
 * reads a rule this way to find the line it draws; the two ask about different atoms — the check
 * names a subject of its own, the measure names a position of a behavior's input — and they are the
 * same arithmetic over the same tree. Written twice, the second copy read fewer shapes than the
 * first, and a rule the check enforced was one the measure reported as unread.
 *
 * <p><b>The grammar and the walk belong here.</b> Which nodes compose — a literal, a negation,
 * {@code +}, {@code -}, a scalar multiply, a binding, a construction of a newtype, and an
 * elimination standing against the introduction that wrote what it reads — is a fact about the
 * language. A caller supplies only the answers that depend on its
 * environment: what an otherwise-uncomposed value is called, what environment lies inside a binding,
 * and which source value a name denotes transparently.
 *
 * <p><b>A caller answers with a {@link Core} and never with a {@link LinearForm}.</b> That is what
 * keeps the environment's answers from becoming a second account of the arithmetic. This walk once
 * took a leaf rule that could answer a binder's reads with the form its value had — an account of
 * arithmetic standing in for an account of meaning, weaker than the environment's by exactly the
 * values the arithmetic cannot read, and inside a reduction's step the only account there was
 * (ADR-0106). {@link Reading#readThrough} puts back a way to reach what a name was given, and its
 * answer is an expression: a caller can say which value a name denotes and cannot say what the
 * arithmetic of it comes to, so reading that expression is this walk's and no one else's
 * (ADR-0111).
 *
 * <p>Two things are the caller's throughout, and every reading and every walk below is written over
 * them: {@code A} is what the caller calls an atom, and {@code E} is what it carries as it goes
 * inside a binding. Neither is declared here — this class holds no state — so each of
 * {@link Reading} and the walks says them for itself.

     *
     * <p><b>One question with one answer, asked by the two readings that have it.</b> Resolving an
     * occurrence needs to know what an elimination came to so it can go on, and reading a form
     * needs to know it so it can compose — and where it comes to nothing, the second has another
     * proof to try. Written out at each of them, one copy would come to read a shape the other did
     * not, and which shapes a rule about eliminations covers would depend on which reader met it.
     *
     * <p><b>Null is the rule not applying, and never the kind of node.</b> A construction that does
     * not give the field asked for has nothing written to stand against, exactly as an expression
     * that is no construction has not — so a caller asking whether the structural reading produced
     * a successor is asking one thing. Read off the node instead, a construction missing the field
     * would count as a reduction this never made.
     *
     * <p>The target resolves before the field is taken, which is what closes this under itself: the
     * value a construction gives a field is reached whether the construction was written where the
     * projection is or stands behind a name and another projection.
     *
     * <p><b>Taken of every value the target can stand at, or of none of them.</b> A projection out
     * of a name that stands for several is that projection out of each of them, and one member with
     * nothing written to stand against takes the answer away for all of them: what a caller is going
     * to state is what the members agree on, and a member this could not eliminate is one it has
