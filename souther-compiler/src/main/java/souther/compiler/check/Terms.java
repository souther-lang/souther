/**
 * What a value is to the invariant-discharge check: where it is, what it is called, and whether
 * anything can be said of it.
 *
 * <p>One question asked in one place. A guard states something of a value and a clause is read
 * against a value, and the two meet only by being named alike — so the naming is here rather than at
 * either end of it, and asking it of a name gives the same answer as asking it of the expression the
 * name was bound to. That is what makes naming an expression not change what is known of it.
 *
 * <p>Three answers, and they are not the same question. Where a value is, is a {@link Location} and
 * is what the seeding writes about. What a value is called, is a key: two expressions with one key
 * compute one value, which is the whole of what the fact set knows. What can be said of a value, is
 * whether a clause read against it could ever be discharged — a location always can, and so does a
 * number this grammar names, whatever computes it; a value of another kind only where a rule or a
 * guard reaches it — and it is what decides whether a construction is reported at all.
 *
 * <p>The middle question does not wait on the third. A value is called something because it can be
 * pointed at, and what is known of it is a separate matter that may well be nothing. Deciding the
 * one by the other is circular where it matters most: the first guard about a value would be read
 * under a naming that guard is what establishes.

     * <p>A step this cannot read as a form is recorded as nothing rather than as a walk with a part
