/**
 * The cases a subject can be selected as, worked out once from the subject's type.
 *
 * <p>A subject is one of three things and they are told apart here and nowhere else: an optional,
 * whose two carriers are the present one and the absent one; an anonymous union, whose cases are its
 * members; a named sum, whose cases are the ones declared with it. Anything else has no cases, and
 * that is an answer rather than a failure — what a reader does about a subject it cannot open is the
 * reader's ({@code E1202} for a {@code match}).
 *
 * <p>What a case comes to is settled here and never asked of the subject again. Two halves of it,
 * and they go to different readers. What to test and what the value is once the test answers is the
 * {@link CaseSelector}, which says that much wherever it is written and is what a backend emits.
 * What selecting the case <em>covers</em> is a fact about the declarations this compile read, and
 * it is the half a later stage cannot work out for itself — so {@link ResolvedCase} is the pair,
 * and it is the pair that crosses into {@code Core}. That is the rule this type exists to keep: the
 * backend used to re-derive optional-ness, arity and or-pattern-ness while emitting, and the
 * readings of an input used to re-derive which distinction an arm picked from its name, which one
 * name over several leaves cannot say (#1252).
