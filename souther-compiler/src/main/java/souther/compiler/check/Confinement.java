/**
 * Which values the positions of one value may take and where their orders stop, as one answer.
 *
 * <p>Two readings and one question. Which values a position may hold is a set, and where its order
 * stops is a range, and neither has a word for what the other holds — a pattern names no ends and an
 * ordering names no finite set. So a clause reaches whichever of them can say something about it,
 * and whether anything satisfies the rules is about the two of them together.
 *
 * <p><b>Which is why nothing else holds them side by side.</b> Asked of each in turn, the answer is
 * that something exists whenever the reading that was asked had nothing to say about the rules, and
 * that sentence was written in five places. Forbidding the spelling leaves a sixth to be written; so
 * the halves are not separately in hand, and the question has one implementation
 * ({@link #admission}) that no holder can answer around.
 *
 * <p><b>Nothing is admitted where the ranges refuse every alternative, and something is admitted
 * only where they were asked.</b> That asymmetry is the whole of what went wrong. Either half
 * holding nothing leaves the pair nothing, so {@link Emptiness#EMPTY} is sound from either of them;
 * {@link Emptiness#NONEMPTY} is a claim about the pair and can only come out of the walk that was
 * handed the ranges. A reading that answered it from the values alone settled a branch as one
 * somebody can be in before anything asked where its positions stop.
 *
 * <p>What is not promised is that a pair nothing showed empty holds anything. The other components
 * of {@link ConstraintState} stay outside this one. Where the state asks whether they can all hold
 * together, what those components can prove about where each position sits is handed in as a
 * {@link PositionEnvelope.Restrictions} and met into this same walk; they are not copied into
 * either reading, and the alternatives are not walked a second time to ask about them.
 *
 * <p>So this owns only which values a position may take and where its order stops, and the walk
 * over the alternatives that both are asked along. {@link ConstraintState} owns the reduction
 * between that answer and the components beside it, and calling this the whole of a conjunction's
 * satisfiability would still be a claim the reductions in it do not carry.
 *
