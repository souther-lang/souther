/**
 * What a module's {@code fake} blocks declare, read once from what resolution answered.
 *
 * <p>A block is where a stand-in is written; it is not the stand-in. The rows of one form an
 * ordered decision list — the first row stating an input is the one that answers — and there is no
 * order between a module's own source and the {@code examples for} files attached to it that could
 * say which of two blocks comes first. So two blocks naming one behavior cannot be composed into
 * one table, and neither of them is the one that answers: what a behavior has here is a count, and
 * the three counts are told apart rather than folded into whether a lookup found something.
 *
 * <p>The three are different facts and a reader acts differently on each. Nothing written is a
 * dependency with no stand-in, which is what a row needs one for. One block written is a table to
 * dispatch with and to hold against the rows recorded for the behavior. More than one is a
 * refusal — the blocks are written and are read as tables in their own right, and none of them
 * stands in for anything. A lookup answering only "found" and "not found" gives a reader the first
 * and third under one answer, and the reader then has to decide which it was.
 *
 * <p>Made in one place because the association is resolution's answer and the count is over the
 * whole module. A consumer holding {@link Hir.Fake}s and reading {@code standsInFor} off them would
 * be making the association again, and one walking the module's list to pick a table for a
 * behavior would be making the count again — which is how a table came to be chosen by the order
 * its file was handed to the compile.
