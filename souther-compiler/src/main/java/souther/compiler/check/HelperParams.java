/**
 * Settles the type of every helper parameter the author left unwritten, reading it off the helper's
 * own body (spec §fn-declaration, issue #176) and writing it back onto the parameter (issue #178).
 *
 * <p>Writing it back is what makes the type reach the helper's expansion. A helper call is rewritten
 * to {@code let $k_p = arg in <body>} carrying the parameter's type onto the binding, so a value the
 * helper knows to be a sum is not narrowed to the case the caller passed when the body is re-checked
 * inline. That happens in {@link Lower}, before the type checker runs, so a type the checker settles
 * would arrive too late — the type is settled here instead, on the tree, and the inliner reads it
 * like any written one. The type is written as a reference with no surface text (see
 * {@link Hir.TypeRef#of}): what a parameter denotes is decided, and no source stands for it.
 *
 * <p>Settling is best-effort and reports nothing. A parameter its body does not determine is left as
 * it was, for {@link HelperTyping} to report where it reports today — so a helper that cannot be
 * typed still names the use that left it open, and one broken helper still does not hide the errors
 * in the rest of the module.
