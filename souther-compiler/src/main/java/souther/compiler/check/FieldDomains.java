/**
 * What a record leaves each of its fields able to hold.
 *
 * <p>Not what the field's own type admits. A clause relating two fields — {@code startsAt < endsAt} —
 * is a rule about pairs, and what one field can hold is that rule projected onto it: with both ends
 * of a day bounded at 1440, {@code startsAt} stops at 1439, because a 1440 would need an
 * {@code endsAt} the day has no room for. Reading the field's type alone names values the record
 * refuses.
 *
 * <p>The bounds are as wide as what the rules could be read as, and only that. {@link #projection}
 * says how much of them that was: a clause outside the fragment — a call, a pattern, a sum of three
 * terms — narrows nothing here, so where one is present these bounds admit values nothing can build.
 * Wide is the safe direction for deciding a value is impossible and the wrong direction for deciding
 * that an edge can be written, which is why the two answers are handed over together.
 *
 * <p><b>Asked by what this value's own rules call a place ({@link RuleKey}), and never by where a
 * row writes a value.</b> The two part at a sum whose cases share a spread: what the cases share is
 * named at the sum, and a row writes it under whichever case it turned out to be. So a place a rule
 * of this value cannot name — inside a sequence, under a case — has no answer here rather than an
 * answer nothing was written at, and taking a name to the places it stands at is somebody else's
 * ({@code InputDomain}).

         * fresh reading of the declaration.
         *
         * <p><b>The whole state and not the numbers alone.</b> Which values a name admits, which
         * predicates hold and where an ordering stops are as much a part of what the rules leave as
         * the arithmetic is, and a caller given the numbers alone would have to ask this reading

         * the one with a place to name, and which of them speaks settled by the order they are asked
         * in. Handed over whole, the caller has one state to ask and this has none.
         *
         * <p><b>Every subject a rule is about is carried, whether or not the caller has a coordinate
         * for it.</b> A reading relates subjects at coordinates and subjects at none, and a rule
         * reaching one of the latter still holds two of the former apart: left behind, that rule
         * would be gone and what the rules leave would come back wider than it is. So a subject with
         * no coordinate is named by {@code otherwise}, out of the subject itself, and the caller is
         * given something to be equal to rather than something to read — what makes two of them one
         * subject was settled here, and a caller inventing its own answer to that would put two
         * apart or two together.

         * another. What keeps two readings apart is not this — each of them is renamed under a
