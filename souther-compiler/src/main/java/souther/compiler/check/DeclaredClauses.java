/**
 * The conjuncts of the rules written on a type, in the order the author wrote them.
 *
 * <p>Every name the value wears, not the outermost one. A rule written on the type a newtype wraps
 * bounds the value as much as one written on the newtype does, and the two are read together:
 * {@code Inner: value >= 0} under {@code Outer: value <= 10} is a range of {@code [0, 10]}, and
 * neither layer alone says so.
 *
 * <p>The names are handed in, never worked out here. Which names a position wears is what reading
 * its type comes to ({@link TypeView#wrappers}), and a second walk to the same place is a second
 * answer to how far a newtype reaches — they would part the day either of them changed. So this is
 * a projection of that reading and takes it as its subject.
 *
 * <p>Grouped by the name each rule is written on, because a caller that has to put the rules in an
 * order has only this to take it from. Which rules govern a value does not turn on the order — every
 * name's do — so nothing here reads one into them, and a caller enumerating them says for itself
 * which end it starts at.
 *
 * <p>Walked once, because the number a conjunct carries is part of an identity. A line is named by
 * the clause and the conjunct it came out of ({@link DeclaredBounds.Drawn}), counted over every
 * conjunct and not over the ones something came of — so a reading that makes nothing of one
 * conjunct still numbers the next as a reading that makes something of it does. A second walk with
 * its own counter would call one authored line two the day the two disagreed about which conjuncts
 * there are.
 *
 * <p>Nothing is read out of a conjunct here. Which number a side of one names is
 * {@link ClauseSubject}'s and where it leaves the values is {@link InvariantBound}'s, and both are
 * projections of the same text rather than steps of one reading. What a conjunct is <em>about</em>
 * is neither of those: it is the canonical quantity its arithmetic came to, which the reading that
 * turns clauses into constraints works out ({@link FieldDomains#writtenAbout}).
