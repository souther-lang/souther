 * <p>The rules and not the check. Introducing a binding, taking a condition as holding, and reading
 * what a type guarantees of a value are answers about a program, and the question they add up to —
 * can anything at all stand here — is asked by more than the check they were written for. Held
 * apart so that there is one reading of it: a second walk that threaded its own narrowing would be
 * a second set of rules, and the two would part company at the first clause a domain other than the
 * numbers has a word for ({@code value == "A"} beside {@code value /= "A"} reaches no number and
 * leaves the predicates contradictory).
 *
 * <p>Nothing here reports anything. What is done with an answer — a clause discharged, an
 * obligation left standing, an arm named as one nothing reaches — is the caller's, and each of them
 * wants a different one. An engine that also decided would settle those before either caller was
 * written.
 *
 * <p>Threaded functionally. Every act answers a new {@link Entered} and leaves what it was given as
 * it was, so a branch read under one condition says nothing about the branch beside it.

     * {@code k} with what {@code e}, having answered, guarantees taken as holding of it: what its
     * type states of any value of that type, and what its behavior declared of every answer it
     * gives.
     *
     * <p>An answer is a value of its type, built through that type's checked constructor — the same
     * argument {@link #enter} rests on for a parameter, for what a {@code match} arm binds, and for
     * what a combinator hands its closure. It was not asked of an answer only because an answer had
     * nothing to be asked about: no subject, so nothing to write the guarantee under. It has one now.
     *
     * <p>What makes an answer one of these is not the shape of the node. It is that whoever produced
     * it had already established what its type states before handing it over — a boundary this check
     * read on its own, or one another compile read and published. A call to a behavior is that today,
     * and if another way of invoking one turns out to carry the same guarantee it belongs here too. A
     * construction written here is not: it is the very thing being judged, and seeding it assumes
     * what the judgement is about. Written that way first, a construction over a value nothing was
     * known of came out proved — and came out proved with the clause meant to establish it taken
     * away, which is the shape of a check that has stopped checking.
     *
     * <p>Only what holds of every answer. A rule under a case is about an answer that is that case,
     * and nothing here has opened one; that rule is taken in where the case is known, which is at the
     * arm ({@link #enteringArm}). A rule under no case holds of whatever the behavior answered, so
     * the call is where it is known.
     *
     * <p>Sound for a behavior that reaches outside the language, and for the same reason it is sound
     * for one that does not. Two writings of such a call are two evaluations and so two subjects, but
     * each invocation answers something its own declaration holds of it. What the effect decides is
     * whether the two may be identified, not whether either of them was declared about.
     *
     * <p>Held of the value and not of the path. What is guaranteed of a value is true wherever that
     * value is named, and an evaluation is named at one place, so there is no branch on which it is
     * less true.
     *
     * <p>Of this expression and of nothing inside it. What a subexpression guarantees is taken in
     * where the walk evaluates that subexpression, which is before it gets here: an evaluation
     * answers after the values it was computed from have answered, and a guarantee read the other
     * way round is a fact about this answer standing where the operands that produce it are still
     * being judged. Read over the whole subtree from out here, that is what it was — a call's
     * guarantee constrains the arguments it relates the answer to, so a construction written in an
     * argument was being discharged by what the call around it promises about a value it has not
     * been given yet.
     *
     * <p>Which also puts the walk and this in one order rather than two. The walk knows what an
     * expression evaluates and when ({@link souther.compiler.core.Evaluated}); a second reading that
     * descended on its own would have to know it again, and the two would answer for a construction
     * and for the answers it is built from separately.
