/**
 * A comparison of a checked body: what its operator placed, and the two values it placed it on.
 *
 * <p><b>The three are one value because they have to agree.</b> What a rule places is a function of
 * the operator it was written with, and every reader below the point where a node was recognised as
 * a comparison needs both: the two sides to read, and the claim to say what the rule states about
 * the line. Passed as separate arguments, the set is only as true as each caller made it; held
 * here, there is nowhere for a claim of one operator to arrive beside the sides of another.
 *
 * <p><b>Made in one place, which is what carries the recognition.</b> {@link #of} is the only way
 * in, so a value of this type is itself the evidence that the operator compares — a reader holding
 * one has no case left for an operator that placed nothing, and no reason to go back to the operator
 * and ask again. A {@code boolean} answering the same question leaves the fact behind at the
 * {@code if}, which is how the readings below came to carry the wider classification and answer for
 * a case none of them could be handed.
 *
 * <p><b>And it holds no node.</b> The binary it was recognised from is one call away from the
 * operator, so a reader holding the node can read again what the recognition already answered, and
 * what stopped one doing so was that nobody had yet. It is also how a reader said <em>which</em>
 * comparison it was talking about — two readers meant one place when they had been handed the same
 * object — and that question has an answer of its own now
 * ({@link souther.compiler.coverage.ComparisonOccurrence}), issued where the comparisons of a
 * module's bodies are enumerated. So there are three questions and three answers: what is compared,
 * which comparison it is, and where it is written.
