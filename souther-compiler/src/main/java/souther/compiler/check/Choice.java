/**
 * A value that is one of several: which several, and what decides each one.
 *
 * <p>One question with one answer. It was asked in four places and each wrote its own list — the
 * search for a split in a value position, the reading of what a split's arms are, the test of
 * whether a node is one, and the recording of what a value was computed from. All four said
 * {@code if} and {@code match}, and none said an attempted construction, which answers what it
 * built where its invariant held and what it departs with where it did not. So an attempt was a
 * value with a name and nothing recorded about the values it is one of, which is what
 * {@link Derivation.Chosen} was made for, standing under a third spelling.
 *
 * <p><b>Not every choice is written as one.</b> An operation the library defines by cases answers one
 * of the values it was given — {@code Int.min(a, b)} is {@code a} or it is {@code b} — and which it
 * is, is decided by how the arguments stand. Where the table saying so is read is here, so that a
 * call is one of these for every reader at once: it was read at one reader only, and a value written
 * where no clause stood over it came out of the walk with no range at all (#974).
 *
 * <p><b>What decides an arm is named here and read nowhere.</b> {@link Decides} is the node that
 * decides — a condition and which way it went, a case of a sum, an attempt that held or departed,
 * the arguments standing as a definition's case names — and this puts no interpretation on it. What
 * such a node means is asked of it in two places, and they ask different questions: what choosing the
 * arm <em>binds</em> is {@link Terms#choosing}'s answer, because what a binder denotes is that
 * class's throughout; what choosing it <em>settles</em> is {@link Conditions#settledBy}'s, where a
 * relation is stated, and needs a domain to come to anything. Keeping the two apart is what lets a
 * reader that only wants the values have them, while a reader that wants more is handed the node
 * rather than going back to the tree to find it for itself.
 *
 * <p>Which is also where a reader is made to stop. {@link Kind} on its own stops nobody: it is a
 * label, and a kind nothing produces is inert — adding one and answering for it compiles, and
 * should. What a new choice really needs is a case in {@link #of}, and then a way for each of its
 * arms to be decided. So the sum to switch over is {@link Decides}, which is what a reader has to
 * interpret to do anything at all, and a new way of deciding an arm fails exhaustiveness at every
 * such reader until it is handled. Every reader of it switches, and none tests for the arm it knows:
 * a reader written as an {@code instanceof} is one a new way of deciding passes straight through,
 * answering that nothing is settled where nobody has yet said what is.
 *
 * <p>That distinction is this class's own history. The forcing was first put on {@link Kind}, at a
 * reader that did not open anything, and a kind could be declared a split while no reader opened
 * one — a tripwire that read as holding, which is worse than none, since the words claimed it.
 *
 * <p><b>What a split asks is not here.</b> A split is what a walk over paths makes of a choice, and
 * it needs the one node deciding between the arms in order to read it where it stands. That node is
 * not something every choice has: {@code Int.min(a, b)} is decided by how two arguments stand and by
 * no expression written anywhere. Held here as a component, it was a field standing empty for such a
 * choice — the over-generalisation kept rather than answered — so it is projected out of
 * {@link Decides} by the reader that opens splits, which has an arm per way of deciding and stops at
 * the ways it does not open.
