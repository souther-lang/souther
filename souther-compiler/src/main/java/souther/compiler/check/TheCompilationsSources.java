/**
 * Where the source a compilation reads a module's rules under is made.
 *
 * <p>Made and not stamped. What such a source says of itself — that a reading from it is the
 * declaration's own as this compilation reads it — is what admits a reader to the reading another
 * reader made, so it may not be said of a pair somebody else assembled. Handed the parts and asked
 * to certify them, this would be certifying whatever it was given: a reader could bring a scope of
 * its own, or a lookup answering for no clause at all, and be handed a reading of rules it was not
 * reading. So nothing is taken here but the module's name, and both halves are read from what the
 * compilation answers.
 *
 * <p>And what is minted here says it came from here. Anybody may build one of these over a scope
 * and a lookup of their own — there is no keeping that from them, since answering for a
 * compilation is exactly what it is to hold those two — but a source minted by one of these is
 * shared only with readers whose source came from the same one. So a rival mint over a scope it
 * borrowed and a lookup answering for nothing mints sources nobody else's readers are handed,
 * whatever module name it writes on them. What makes a source the compilation's is that the
 * compilation's own sources made it, and a store holds one of these.
 *
 * <p>Not what a reader holds. A reading of a declaration borrows from
 * {@link DeclarationReadings}, and what that hands out is what somebody has already made; where a
 * module's rules are read from is not a reader's to decide, and is not on offer there.
