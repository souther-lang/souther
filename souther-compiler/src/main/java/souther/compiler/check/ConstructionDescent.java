/**
 * Where a value at a position has to be built, one step down.
 *
 * <p>A record is composed out of its fields, and a value at every other shape is chosen rather than
 * composed: a sum is one of its cases and which one is settled before anything under it is, what a
 * sequence holds is placed inside it and is not a field of it, and a primitive is a value already.
 * So this answers about a record and answers nothing anywhere else, which is the whole of what the
 * question has to say.
 *
 * <p><b>Not what is readable at the position.</b> {@link ReadableFields} answers that. The two are
 * the same map at a record, and a sum whose cases share a spread is where they part: those names
 * are readable at every value of the sum and a product of them is a value of none of its cases. A
 * plan taking the readable answer here would compose a value of no case at all.
 *
 * <p><b>One step and no walk.</b> How far down to follow it, where to stop because the caller has
 * already settled something, and what type stands at a path once a construction recipe has chosen
 * one belong to whoever is asking. Handed here as settings they would make this the thing that
 * decides which positions there are, with a caller's argument deciding which set it answers.
