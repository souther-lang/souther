/**
 * Which readings took each clause into their own semantics.
 *
 * <p>Recorded where each reading runs, and by that reading. A caller working out from a clause's
 * spelling which reading ought to have managed it is guessing at another reader's semantics — which
 * is the defect this exists to stop, one level over from the one it was written for: an ordering
 * bound is unreadable to the reading that turns clauses into sets of values and is read whole by two
 * others, and the shape says nothing about which of them managed it.
 *
 * <p>Per clause, because that is the granularity a question has. Asked per position, one clause's
 * failure is the account of every clause beside it: {@code invariant floor = value >= 1} leaves the
 * reading of values short at a position, and {@code invariant seven = value == 7} written beside it
 * was taken in whole and came back reported as unread.
 *
 * <p>Filed under {@link RuleRef} and not under the clause reference the walk had in hand. Every
 * clause reaching here is an invariant's, so the two would key the same map today — and the value
 * recorded here is carried to a report, where what names a rule is the rule. Weakened on the way
 * out, each reader downstream had to work the identity back out for itself.
 *
 * <p>Success and not attempt. A reading that recognised part of a clause and gave up took nothing
 * in, so nothing here records it — what is written down is the point at which a reading adopted the
 * clause into what it holds.
 *
 * <p>Every part of the clause, and not one of them. A conjunction is one rule the author wrote and
 * is read one conjunct at a time; a clause half of which nothing took in is a clause nothing took
 * in, and answering it on the strength of the half that was read is how {@code value >= 1 &&
 * value * value >= 4} came back with nothing to say while the same two rules written apart were
 * reported. The same reading {@code Predicates.Owed.and} makes of a clause it could not read all
 * of.
 *
 * <p><b>Every reading, and each one asked at its own adoption point.</b> There are more of them than
 * a reader notices: {@code value * 2 >= 4} is beyond the reading of ends and beyond the reading of
 * values, and the reading that builds the numeric constraints takes it in whole. An accounting that
 * consulted two of the three would report that clause exactly the way #842 reports a bound — as a
 * rule this compiler could not read, about a model it had read.
