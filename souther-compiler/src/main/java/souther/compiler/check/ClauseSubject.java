/**
 * Which number of a value a comparison names on one of its sides, with that side read as the left
 * one.
 *
 * <p><b>What a rule is about is not this.</b> That is the canonical quantity its arithmetic came to
 * ({@link FieldDomains#writtenAbout}), and this is the narrower thing the reading of ends needs: an
 * end is read off a comparison of a number against something, so what that reading has to recognise
 * is a side that is the number. {@code String.length(value) * 2 >= 4} is about the length and this
 * answers nothing for it, which is why nothing choosing what a position is measured on may ask
 * here.
 *
 * <p>Above the reading of ends and not a step of it, which is what it is for. Whether a comparison
 * places an end and which number it names are two questions: {@code String.length(value) /= 0}
 * names the length and places no end, and {@code String.length(value) == 5} names it and places
 * both at once. Recognised inside the end reading, a rule that places none is a rule about nothing.
 *
 * <p>Nothing about the other side comes into it. A side is the number it is whether or not what it
 * stands against is something this compiler can fold: what the other side holds decides where an
 * end lands, and decides nothing about which number was named.
 *
 * <p>The comparison is handed back turned, so that the number this recognised is the side the claim
 * is stated of. A reader turning it again would be recognising the subject a second time to find
 * out which way round it already is.
 *
 * @param number     the number of the value the conjunct is written about
 * @param comparison the conjunct as a comparison, with {@code number} on the left
