/**
 * What came of trying to read one clause statically.
 *
 * <p>Three answers, and the first two are conclusions about the clause while the third is not. "The
 * reading finished and these are the parts to establish" and "the clause came out one way on its
 * own" are both things the model settles. "The reading did not finish" is a fact about this compiler
 * on this run, and it settles nothing — whether the clause is inside the fragment is exactly what was
 * not found out. Held as one answer, an author is told that no guard discharges their construction
 * because an analysis fell over on it, and nothing fails while that is happening, since a stop and a
 * negative conclusion are both silent.
 *
 * <p>Read off what the walk that reads clauses answered, and not worked out beside it. The walk
 * normalizes before it reads — {@code Int.compare(1, 2) >= 0} is a call until it becomes
 * {@code 1 >= 2} — so a reader folding the written form first sees a call, and comes back with a
 * relation any guard implying it would discharge for a clause no value satisfies.
