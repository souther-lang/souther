/**
 * What the names a module writes can mean, worked out against a {@link ModuleUniverse}.
 *
 * <p>The one place a module's name-resolution environment is derived. A universe supplies facts
 * about modules — what it has under a name — and everything after that is here: what a bare type
 * name denotes, which module a qualifier stands for, what a bare name in the value namespace
 * reaches, and what an import line could not do.
 *
 * <p>Written this way because the same rules were being applied twice, once by a compilation
 * reading its own sources and once by a reader putting published classes back together, and each
 * was right on its own. What that cost was a module that compiled in the project that wrote it and
 * refused to be imported anywhere else: the two readings disagreed about what one import line
 * brought in, and nothing was written down that said they had to agree. So which universe answered
 * is the only thing that differs between the two; what is done with the answers is this.
 *
 * <p>Nothing here reports. An import line that names a module nothing has is a {@link Refusal}, and
 * what to do about one is the caller's: a compilation says it to the author, and a reader that is
 * only reading takes it as this module not being readable here. A walk that made diagnostics could
 * not be used by the second reader without saying things to nobody.
