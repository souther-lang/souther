/**
 * A module's clauses as the discharge analysis reads them — the one thing that hands a reader a
 * clause to classify.
 *
 * <p>Reading a clause is four facts, and every one of them has been got wrong by somebody deriving
 * it for themselves: <em>what the author wrote</em>, <em>where they wrote it</em>, <em>which
 * representation the analysis reads it in</em>, and <em>whether all of it was read</em>. They are not
 * independent — the position belongs to the written form, the analysis wants the expanded one, and an
 * expansion carries the positions of the body it copies in — so a reader holding some of them and
 * working out the rest is a reader that can hold a matched set or a mismatched one with nothing to
 * tell them apart. Both kinds of clause had a reader of their own doing exactly that, and they
 * disagreed: the data reader placed its answers on what was written and the rule reader placed them
 * on what it had expanded.
 *
 * <p>So the facts arrive together or not at all. This owns the expansion and never hands it out, and
 * what it gives back is a {@link ClauseReading} — a written conjunct that knows where it is and what
 * it comes to. There is no argument anywhere below for a reader to pass a position in, which is what
 * makes the wrong position unwritable rather than merely wrong.
 *
 * <p>What is <em>not</em> here is the reading the check itself does of a whole clause
 * ({@link ClauseHelpers}). That answers a different question — what a
 * construction owes — and is read against the values a construction hands over rather than placed in
 * front of an author.
