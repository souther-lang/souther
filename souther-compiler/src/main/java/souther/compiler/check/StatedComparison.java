 *
 * <p><b>Beside {@link Comparison} and not the same thing.</b> That one is a binary the source wrote,
 * recognised where it stands, and what it carries besides the claim is the node — which is what a
 * reader asking where a comparison is in the tree wants ({@link
 * souther.compiler.coverage.ComparisonCatalog}). This one is a statement, and a statement has no
 * place in the tree: a reading that works out what an operation answering an order proves about its
 * two arguments states a comparison no author wrote, and there is nowhere it stands.
 *
 * <p><b>And it carries no site.</b> A comparison is filed under what it places and the terms its two
 * sides are ({@link Terms}), so where a comparison came from, what it answers and where it stands
 * decide nothing a reader of this asks. Carrying them would leave one field whose only use is
 * putting the node back together, and putting the node back together is what a statement exists
 * instead of. Whoever reports about a clause holds the expression the source wrote and reports about
