/**
 * What the clauses of one rule say, in each of the languages a clause is read in.
 *
 * <p>Two languages and one reading. Which values a position may take is a set, and where a position
 * stops is a range, and neither says what the other says — an ordering names no finite set, and a
 * set of values has no word for what lies between two of them. So a clause reaches whichever of them
 * has a word for it, and some clauses reach both.
 *
 * <p><b>The tree the author wrote, node for node.</b> A conjunction stands where it was written and
 * a choice's alternatives are what stands between its brackets ({@link #mirrors}). Which values a
 * position may take is another matter — settled by every clause together, so a conjunction there
 * distributes over a choice and a branch is refined by clauses written beside it — and that is a
 * rewriting the reading performs rather than one an author wrote. It happens in the projection onto
 * {@link StatedTogether} ({@link Reading#together}), which this type cannot be reached from: the
 * one thing coming back is the fate of each choice ({@link Settlement}).
 *
 * <p>So everything a choice is answerable for is asked here, of the alternatives as written. Asked
 * over the tree that derives values, a conjunct written beside a choice is a conjunct of both its
 * alternatives, and a form nothing reads written there makes both of them alternatives nothing
 * could read — sending an author to a choice that reads perfectly well.
 *
 * <p><b>One rule's, and never met with another rule's.</b> This tree answers what one rule's own
 * clauses took in, and that answer must come from those clauses alone — a constraint a neighbouring
 * rule states does not change what this one read, however much it changes what the value admits. The
 * conjunction across rules is written over {@link StatedTogether} and has no operation here to
 * arrive by.
 *
 * <p><b>The connectives are over this and not over either of them.</b> A choice between two
 * alternatives is a choice between two readings of the whole value, so an alternative that cannot be
 * taken is dropped by asking the whole of what is known about it
 * ({@link PlannedValues#holdsNothingAsBuilt}). Applied
 * inside each language on its own, the drop happened only where the language doing the joining was
 * also the one that could show the branch impossible: {@code s < "" || (b == true && b == false)}
 * has a branch no order admits beside a branch no set of values admits, and each language, joining
 * alone, found nothing wrong with the branch the other one had refused. The same shape appears
 * inside one language across two positions, since a join keeps only what both sides spoke about.
 *
 * <p><b>Two of the four domains of {@link ConstraintState} are not here, and it is not an
 * oversight.</b> The interval algebra and the predicates are what a construction owes
 * ({@link Predicates}), which is a different question about the same clause: an alternative owes a
 * construction nothing a guard could discharge, so neither of them ever reads a branch of a choice.
 * A branch impossible only by an arithmetic relation between two positions is one nothing here can
 * drop, and giving those two a reading of alternatives is its own change with its own reason.
