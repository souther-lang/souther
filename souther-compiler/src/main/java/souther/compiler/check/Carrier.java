/**
 * An order a rule is read against and a value is written back at, and the only place either
 * direction is crossed.
 *
 * <p>A type takes part by having an order-preserving count for its values <em>and a way back</em>.
 * Whether a type has both is this question, asked here and nowhere else: it was answered in three
 * places that disagreed — a predicate deciding what a report said, a reader deciding what an
 * invariant bounded, and a table deciding how a value was written back — so a {@code Date} was a
 * carrier to one of them and not to another, and the disagreement showed up as a bound that
 * vanished without a word.
 *
 * <p><b>One type and not two.</b> Reading a rule and writing a value were separate types while a
 * {@code Time} and an {@code Instant} could be read and not written, and what kept them apart was
 * two conversions nobody had written rather than anything about the values. Written, the two are
 * carriers like the rest and the smaller type had no members left: a distinction no value takes is
 * one nothing can check, and the next reader would have had to guess what it claimed (issue #846).
 *
 * <p><b>Closed both ways.</b> Everything that turns a value into a {@link Count} and everything that
 * turns a {@link Count} back into a value is a method here. Outside them nothing may read a count as
 * a number a model wrote, or build a value out of one: those were the leaks, and each of them was a
 * reader that had a carrier available and did not ask it. A reader that sniffed a written temporal
 * for a {@code T} to decide whether it was counting days or seconds is the shape they all had — the
 * declared type says which, and guessing from the text is a second answer to a question already
 * answered.
 *
 * <p><b>Sealed, so a carrier added is one every reader has to answer for.</b> Each switch below is
 * over these eight and nothing else, which is what makes a ninth a build failure rather than a wrong
 * value. That mattered least while every carrier's counts looked like numbers a model might write;
 * an ordinal is a small integer, which is the most plausible-looking wrong value of them all and the
 * one a report is least likely to give away.
 *
 * <p><b>Which types have one</b> is {@link #ofValue}, and it is the one table. Deciding twice is
 * what left a {@code Date} a carrier to one reader and not to another.
