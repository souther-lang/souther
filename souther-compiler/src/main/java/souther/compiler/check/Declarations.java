/**
 * What a semantic identity is a declaration of.
 *
 * <p>The other half of what a module needs, and not the half {@link Scope} answers: this takes an
 * identity and never a spelling, so nothing here has to know which module is being compiled. A
 * reader holding one of these has already resolved whatever it is asking about.
 *
 * <p>{@code D} is the representation the declarations are in, and a representation is all it is.
 * Everything below {@code Resolve} holds {@link Hir}; {@code Resolve} reads the declarations of the
 * modules it resolves against as they were written, because a name written there is that module's to
 * resolve and not this one's. What {@code D} does not say is how far the declarations have got,
 * because the two sources below have got different distances — the language's vocabulary is loaded
 * resolved and derivation never runs over it — so a {@code D} naming a rung would be false of one of
 * them. Which rung a reader is at is which of these it was handed.
 *
 * <p>Two sources, kept apart. {@link Registry} is what this compilation declares, read one
 * declaration at a time; the language's own vocabulary — the data the standard library declares — is
 * declared by no module of the compilation and is answered beside it. {@link #declaration} sees
 * both, because a name that denotes one types like a name that denotes the other;
 * {@link #declaredByCompilation} sees only the first, because a construction set is made of the
 * data a compilation declares and never of the language's vocabulary.
 *
 * <p>Asked one identity at a time. {@link #declaredIn} enumerates, for the questions that really are
 * about a whole module — which sum a case belongs to, what a "did you mean" may offer — and is not
 * how {@link #declaration} is answered. Reading a module's declarations to reach one of them makes
 * the reader depend on all of them, and the failure of any one of them becomes the failure of every
 * question about the rest.
