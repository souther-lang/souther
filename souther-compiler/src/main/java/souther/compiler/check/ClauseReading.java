/**
 * A clause tree read into one state, the connectives being the same whatever the parts are read as.
 *
 * <p>What a clause is written out of — a conjunction, a choice, a denial — is the clause's own shape
 * and not a fact about the language it is read in. Written once per language, that shape is the same
 * code as many times as there are languages, and each copy is free to drift from the others.
 *
 * <p><b>And the connectives belong to the clause and not to a component of the state.</b> That is
 * what this is for. A choice between two alternatives is a choice between two <em>readings of the
 * whole value</em>, so the alternative that cannot be taken has to be dropped by asking the whole of
 * what is known about it. Applied inside each language on its own, an alternative was dropped only
 * where the language doing the joining was also the one that could show it impossible — and a choice
 * between a branch no order admits and a branch no set of values admits came out open, each language
 * having found nothing wrong with the branch the other one refused.
 *
 * <p><b>What a clause states is answered upward and what its names mean is handed downward.</b> A
 * reading composes its parts into one answer, and that answer is a function of the parts; the
 * environment a part is read in is a function of the bindings above it, which is the other
 * direction. Carried only upward, there was nowhere for a binding to be, so a clause under one was
 * a shape every reading had no word for — and since almost every binding this check meets is one a
 * helper's expansion made, a rule stated through a helper was read less than the same rule written
 * out.
 *
 * <p>So {@code E} is handed down and {@code S} comes back up, and a part is read at the environment
 * it stands in. What a binding does to that environment is not asked of a reading: the fold finds
 * the boundary and {@link ClauseScope} answers it, which is what keeps a binder's meaning the
 * environment's (ADR-0106) rather than something each of three readings works out again.
 *
 * <p><b>A part is not the same thing for every reading.</b> Where a reading stops is its own answer
 * ({@link Descent}), so the node an author wrote a connective at is a part to a reading that takes
 * it whole and is none to a reading that descends. What every reading shares is the shape below it,
 * not the depth it reads to.
 *
 * @param <S> what a reading of a clause comes to
 * @param <E> what the reading carries into a binding — what its parts are read at

     * given the node alone works whichever of them it needs out of the tree again, which is the
