/**
 * What a behavior states about its answer, read into the representation the analysis has rules
 * about and typed there.
 *
 * <p>Two readers want this and they want the same thing of it. The editor asks how much of each rule
 * the check can read; the check at a call asks what of it may be taken as holding. Both are questions
 * about the rule as a term — which case it is about, which names it reads, what it comes to — so it
 * is read once, here, and each of them takes what it needs. Read twice, the answer shown to an author
 * and the answer a caller is given would be two readings that have to be kept agreeing.
 *
 * <p>Every conjunct arrives placed and typed together ({@link Conjunct}). The rest of this package
 * has been got wrong twice by carrying those apart.
