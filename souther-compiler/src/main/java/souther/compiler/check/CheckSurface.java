/**
 * The module a best-effort reading of a compilation runs over, assembled once.
 *
 * <p>It carries no claim that every declaration derived or that the module can be emitted. What it
 * is, is the one place the parts are put together: an imported name written as the definition it
 * denotes, a definition held to what it came out as, an example and a fake table written the same
 * way, and a definition minted for what each row writes at a position. Every reader that wants a
 * whole module to walk over gets it from here, so those are decided once and never counted out
 * again.
 *
 * <p>Its declarations are the ones {@link Normalized} answered for, handed in rather than worked out
 * here: failing to derive a representation does not put an earlier spelling back into the tree. A
 * module holding one declaration that could not be derived is still read for what its other
 * definitions say, and the declaration that could not be derived is here in the form every reader
 * below the settling expects — not beside them in a spelling one rung up, which nothing in a tree
 * would say was different.
 *
 * <p>Not a rung, and it says so ({@link Assembly}). What a state of this package says is that
 * something was established of a value; what this says is where the parts were joined.
 * {@link Prepared} is the state — it is this assembly beside the witness that every declaration came
 * out — and a reader that has to have a whole module asks for that one.
