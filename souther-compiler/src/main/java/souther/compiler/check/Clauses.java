 * fields it is written against, and read at a value by putting what each field is being given where
 * that field is read.
 *
 * <p>That reading is what lets the check hold one representation. A clause belongs to a declaration
 * and the values belong to a body, and a clause read over its own tree and a body read over another
 * would be two term grammars that have to be kept naming the same value the same way. A field is a
 * binding, so putting a value there is a substitution, and what comes out is an expression of the
 * body's own kind.
 *
 * <p>Everything here is remembered, because both the seeding and every construction ask the same
