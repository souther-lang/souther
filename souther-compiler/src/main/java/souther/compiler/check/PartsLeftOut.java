/**
 * Which authored part of which rule a reading was asked to leave out.
 *
 * <p>Beside {@link RulesLeftOut} and not a finer setting of it. That one leaves out every rule some
 * declaration wrote, and what it is asked with is a declaration; this leaves out one part of one
 * rule, and what it is asked with is the name that part was issued under. The two are different
 * questions about different things, and a reading told to leave out "a part" with no rule beside it
 * would leave out whatever else happened to be written the same way.
 *
 * <p><b>The name and not the tree.</b> A part is named where a clause is split ({@link PartId}), so
 * a reading told to leave one out is told which one and has nothing to recognise. Named by its tree
 * instead, every reading that had to skip it matched a node — and a reading asked without a part
 * types the clause again, so what it walks is a node equal to the one named rather than the same
 * one, which is a match that holds only while two identical parts of one clause never both come up.
 *
 * <p>What such a reading is for is not here. A reader comparing what a value's rules leave with and
 * without one part is asking what that part was holding; nothing about the comparison belongs to
 * the reading that answers it.
