/**
 * The numbers of one value whose ends nothing worked out, and what stands between each of them and
 * the walk that raises a rule's questions.
 *
 * <p>One question and one answer: of the ends a part of a clause states, which are the ones nothing
 * worked out. Whether anybody can be in a branch, which positions a choice leaves as wide as they
 * are, and whether the model raises a question anywhere are three other questions with three other
 * owners, and nothing here decides any of them — what is done with their answers is to strike
 * numbers off this one.
 *
 * <p><b>What stands at a place, and never a number an operation answers of it.</b> Both are numbers
 * a rule can state a line on, and they are two orders with two readings — so the second is left
 * open where its own reading settles what the alternatives leave it
 * ({@link BoundaryState}), and reaches a document by the road this one takes. Carried here as well,
 * the rule below would be asked whether the branch beside it bounds a length, which is a question
 * the reading of ends has no word for and would answer no to.
 *
 * <p><b>A choice never puts a number in here.</b> {@link #either} keeps only what its alternatives
 * brought to it, so a choice can strike a number off and can add none: it may show that the branch
 * beside an unfollowed one leaves the number at every value, and it has nothing else to say. So a
 * number here was put here by a leaf whose reading gave up on it, and the choices above it are the
 * road, not the source.
 *
 * <p><b>The road is what says whether anything else is telling a reader.</b> The walk that turns a
 * rule into the questions it raises goes into a conjunction and stops at a choice, so an end left
 * open with no choice between it and that walk is one the rule's own questions already leave
 * standing. What is carried here is that a written choice stands between — whether or not one of
 * them can be named — because that is exactly what nothing else reaches.
 *
 * <p><b>Named and answerable are not the same.</b> A choice one alternative of which nobody can be
 * in is not an alternative any more: what is left is the branch that stands, the walk never went
 * into it, and there is no branch for an author to look at. So such an end is carried with the
 * choice unnamed rather than dropped — the line at the position was not derived either way, and
 * which of the two it is decides what a document may say and not whether the measure is short.
 *
 * <p><b>The choice an end reaches with nothing else to name, and not every choice above.</b> An end
 * arriving at a choice already answerable for it has been named for that one, and naming the choice
 * above as well would send an author to a bracket rather than to a clause. Where the alternative
 * beside it leaves the same end open on its own account, both are named and both have to be lifted:
 * that is a fact about the rule rather than about how it was bracketed, and
 * {@code (a || b) || c} and {@code a || (b || c)} come to the same choices either way round.
 *
 * @param byNumber every number whose end this part left open, under the name its own reading files
 *                 it by. Empty where the part's ends were all worked out
