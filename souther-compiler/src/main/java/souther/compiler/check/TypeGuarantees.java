/**
 * What a type guarantees of a value, asked one value at a time.
 *
 * <p>The one reading of a declaration. A value of type {@code T} was built through {@code T}'s
 * checked constructor, so what {@code T} states holds of it; that argument is the same for a
 * behavior's parameter, for what a {@code match} arm binds, for what an attempt built, and for what
 * a combinator hands a closure. Each of those has a reader, and none of them may come to a different
 * answer about what the declaration says — so the answer is here and the readers ask.
 *
 * <p><b>A question about one value, not a walk over what it holds.</b> Everything a walk would carry
 * — how deep to go, which names to leave out, what a stop costs, what is being measured — is missing
 * on purpose. A caller that wants what is readable here asks {@link At#readable} and decides for
 * itself whether to go there. Held the other way, the depth a walk could afford would be part of
 * what a declaration means, and two callers that could afford different depths would be two readings
 * of the model.
 *
 * <p><b>What the model writes where a value stands is {@link ValueReading}'s answer.</b> Nothing
 * here resolves a name to a declaration, so this cannot come to a conclusion of its own about what
 * kind of value it is reading — which declarations state something of every value here, and what is
 * readable on one, are settled before this starts.
 *
 * <p>Nothing here mentions {@link Known}, a path, or a {@link InvariantChecker.Gathering}. Reading a
 * clause as an assumption cannot consult what was already known ({@link Predicates.Discharge}), so
 * there is nothing for a caller's knowledge to change about the answer.
