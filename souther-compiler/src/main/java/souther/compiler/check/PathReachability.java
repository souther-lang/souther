/**
 * What the model's own rules say arrives at each place in a behavior's body.
 *
 * <p>The reading the invariant-discharge check already makes, answered as a fact instead of
 * consumed as a step. That check threads what holds where it stands and returns at a place the
 * conditions cannot all hold — which is exactly the question every measure asks about an arm, and
 * every measure was answering it again from the declarations alone, with no way to know what the
 * guards above had established. Two guards on one position left the second one's departure owed a
 * row that nothing can write.
 *
 * <p>Held by {@link ControlPointId} and not by probe number. An arm answering {@code unreachable}
 * has no probe, and it is the arm a claim is about.
 *
 * <p><b>Only a proof excludes, and nothing here proves that something arrives.</b> A state the
 * domains found no contradiction in is a state they had nothing to say about, so this answers
 * {@link Reachability.Unsettled} there rather than {@link Reachability.Reachable} — what earns the
 * latter is a run, or a rule that settles the question completely, and neither is read here.
 *
 * <p>A place this walk did not get to is absent, which {@link Answers#at} reads as unsettled. That
 * is the fail-open direction and it is the one that costs nothing: an obligation stays owed and
 * nothing is reported.
