/**
 * Where the declarations of a compilation are read from. {@link Symbols} answers what a name means
 * here; this answers what any module declares, which is the part that is not about "here" at all.
 *
 * <p>Three questions, and no more: a module's definitions, what it exposes, and which modules there
 * are. Keeping it to that is the point — a registry that handed out {@code Hir.Module} would let a
 * caller reach a module's behaviors, examples or fns and so depend on which pass had last rewritten
 * it, which is how a definition's meaning came to depend on the whole compile.
 *
 * <p>Every question here is a lookup, and no lookup refuses. A registry is built out of declarations
 * that have already been indexed, so whether a module's declarations can be indexed at all is
 * settled by whoever built it, once, where there is still somebody to answer — and every asker
 * afterwards gets the same answer. Working them out on first use is what put a refusal behind a
 * lookup: the reader that caught the first ask was caught by the second, because a module named with
 * a qualifier is asked for again while some other module is being resolved.
