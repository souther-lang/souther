/**
 * What the model writes where a value stands, read one step at a time.
 *
 * <p>The one step every reading of a declaration takes. Which declarations state something of every
 * value here, what is readable on such a value, and what stands below that no reading here takes in
 * are three facts about a type, and every reader wants some of them. Each working them out from the
 * declaration is how a sum comes to be a value that states nothing to one reader, a value with a
 * readable field to a second, and a class with an accessor to a third.
 *
 * <p><b>Two readings, because a name worn over a value and a value with its names off are not the
 * same thing to read.</b> {@link UnderAName} is one nominal layer: what the name wraps is read at
 * the name the declaration gives it. {@link AtAValue} is the value underneath every such name, whose
 * readable surface is {@link ReadableFields}' answer and whose cases are handed on. Held as one
 * record with a flag saying which it was, the flag was free to say "a name is worn" beside a
 * readable surface no name has.
 *
 * <p><b>What a name is called, never whether reading it goes anywhere.</b> A newtype's {@code value}
 * is read at this same value, and a record's field is read one step in; which of the two a name is
 * is {@link Location#isStep}'s answer, asked by whoever writes a path down. Answered here, a walk
 * would take its step from the reading and the rule would have two statements.
 *
 * <p>Nothing here resolves a name to a declaration to find out what kind of thing it is;
 * {@link TypeView} has done that, and this says what the model writes at each kind. Nothing here
 * reads a clause, a value, or a path either. What a clause states of a value in hand is
 * {@link TypeGuarantees}, which asks this where it starts; how far to walk is {@link GuaranteeWalk}'s.
