/**
 * What stays fixed while one definition is checked: the module's symbol table, the {@code data} an
 * invariant or a codec is written against, the injected behaviors a body may call, and whether the
 * expression being checked is a value being given to a {@code ?} field — the one place an optional is
 * made (ADR-0011).
 *
 * <p>None of them changes as the walk descends into an expression, so they travel together rather than
 * as separate parameters threaded through every method. What does change — the variable environment and
 * the expected type pushed down from the surrounding context — is passed separately.
 *
 * <p>Two of them are declaration authorities and neither is read off the other. {@link Symbols} is
 * what a name written here means and what this module's world holds; {@link PublishedDeclarations}
 * is what a declaration says about itself, wherever it was written. Held side by side because one
 * check needs both and because a carrier that answered the second through the first would be
 * answering what a declaration says out of the tree it was written in.
