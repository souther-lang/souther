/**
 * How many values the value at a name may take, which is not how much it holds.
 *
 * <p>The same numbers answer two questions and they are never one question. A rule reading
 * {@code >= 2} bounds the values of a field where the field is a number and counts what it holds
 * where something counts it, and a set asked to hold two of an element bounded to a single number is
 * refused on the first reading of the element and the second of the set. Kept apart from
 * {@link OccurrenceCounts} for that reason and not because the readings differ.
 *
 * <p>An upper bound and not a count. A rule the reading could not take in leaves the ends wider than
 * the values reach — a range of eight with a hole in it is eight here and seven in fact — and that is
 * the direction this is for. What the number may never be is short of the values there are, so it is
 * given only where both ends are there and the values between them are spaced one apart. Where they
 * are spaced at all, which the ends themselves do not say: a decimal bounded at either end lies
 * between two whole numbers as readily as an integer does, and there are unboundedly many of it.
 *
 * <p>A declaration whose rules contradict answers nothing here: the ends are gone along with
 * everything else the domain held. That a type has no value at all is
 * {@link FieldDomains#infeasible()}, asked of the declaration and before this.
