/**
 * What an expression is made of, as the reader that looked it up found it.
 *
 * <p>Two questions were being answered by one word. Which positions a side of a comparison names is
 * about what the rule is over; whether an operation stands between those positions and the value
 * being compared is about what it would take to follow the rule back to them. They are not the same
 * question and they do not refuse each other — {@code Int.add(a, b)} names two positions and is an
 * operation's answer — so a classification that made a side one or the other had to drop whichever
 * it was not asked for, and the reason a rule went unread was picked from what was left.
 *
 * <p><b>The walk and the grammar are here; the environment's answers are the caller's.</b> Which
 * nodes hold what — an application of an operation, the language's own arithmetic, a value written
 * out — is a fact about the language, and it is read once. What a name denotes, which expression is
 * a position, and where a value that is no position came from depend on what the reader is looking
 * at, and are asked of {@link Reading}. Written twice, the two copies of this walk disagreed about
 * whether {@code y + 1} named anything (spec §example-partition).
