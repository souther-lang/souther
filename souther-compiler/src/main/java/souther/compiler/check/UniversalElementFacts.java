/**
 * What holds of every element a container expression holds, wherever the container came from.
 *
 * <p>Read off the tree the discharge check is given, which is one where the library's own operations
 * are still calls ({@code InliningPolicy#DISCHARGE}). So this is not a record of what some earlier
 * pass observed: it is the same question asked again of the expression a container is written as —
 * what its own type and its own written-out elements say, and what a construction keeps of the
 * container it was built from.
 *
 * <p>Keyed by the path under an element and not by a subject. What holds of an element is a fact
 * about {@code amount} of every element, or about the element itself ({@code ""}); which value the
 * reader is standing at, and what that value is called there, is the reader's own question. That is
 * what lets a producer and a consumer that share no binder share a fact: {@code List.map(x -> x.value,
 * xs)} says of the list it answers that every element of it is at or above nought, and the fold or
 * the accumulation that walks that list never met {@code x}.
 *
 * <p>Everything here holds of <em>every</em> element, so a reader may assume it of the one element
 * it is standing at. Nothing that holds of some elements belongs here, and nothing about how many
 * elements there are: that a container written out with nothing in it makes a walk answer its seed
 * is true and is not this — it is a fact about the count, and stating it here would make a reader
 * that assumes these of an element assume something no element satisfies.
