/**
 * Which of a body's bindings hold an element of a container, and of which container.
 *
 * <p>A fact about the program and not about any reader of it. What a standard-library operation
 * hands its closure is stated by the library's own signature ({@link Combinators}); this is that
 * statement made about one body's bindings, at the one point in the pipeline where it can still be
 * read.
 *
 * <p><b>Taken before the relation is erased, and not recovered afterwards.</b> The tree the backend
 * emits from has no combinator left in it: a fold that only grows a collection is rewritten into a
 * walk over a builder, and two such walks in a row are joined into one, so what handed a closure an
 * element is gone and which closure a value came from is no longer a question the tree answers. A
 * reader downstream of that has to recognise the shapes the rewrite happens to produce, which makes
 * the set of combinators it can read a consequence of an optimisation — and the day the optimisation
 * learns a new shape, the reading narrows with nothing saying so.
 *
 * <p>So the relation is read where it stands and carried by binding. What survives the rewrite is
 * the binding: it renames nothing, so a fact keyed this way is as true after it as before. What does
 * mint bindings is a body being copied, and there the fact is carried across the copy's own renaming
 * rather than surviving on its own ({@link ElementProvenance.CopyableFactKind}). Nothing
 * here is recovered by matching one tree against another, and no identity is invented for the
 * purpose — {@link BindingId} already tells one occurrence from another, which is exactly what a
 * helper expanded at two call sites needs and exactly what the construct an author wrote must not be
 * asked to do.
 *
 * <p>What a binding holds is kept as the expression it was read from rather than as a position.
 * Which position that expression names is a question about a behavior's declared input, and a
 * container is not always one — it can be what another operation answered, which is where a reading
 * of provenance goes on rather than stopping ({@link ElementLineage}).
