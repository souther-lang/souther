/**
 * The Lower stage (ADR-0021): rewrites the surface AST toward the form the backend emits, so the
 * backend only emits and never rewrites. It runs before the type checker, whose body check consumes
 * the lowered form (a behavior's permission and {@code depends on} are defined on the inlined body,
 * spec §blocks).
 *
 * <p>It inlines every behavior-implementing {@code fn} body once (spec §blocks) and desugars the
 * body-level constructs that have a plain-AST equivalent — currently the guard-only list
 * comprehension {@code [e | g]}, which becomes {@code if g then [e] else []}. The backend then
 * emits from the lowered module instead of re-running the inliner or shaping these constructs
 * itself, and the type checker's body check consumes the same lowered form. Helper fns are left
 * untouched — they are inlined at their call sites, so a comprehension inside one is desugared once
 * it lands in a behavior body.
