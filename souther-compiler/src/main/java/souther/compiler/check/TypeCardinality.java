/**
 * How many values every type has at most, over the declarations a module reaches.
 *
 * <p>An upper bound throughout, and the answer it exists to give is the one at the bottom: a type
 * this puts at none is a type nothing can build. Everything else it says is what makes that answer
 * reachable — a set cannot be filled from an element with fewer values than it holds, and knowing
 * that means counting the element.
 *
 * <p>Rising from nothing shown rather than narrowing from anything. A value of a type is built, and a
 * type written in terms of itself with nowhere to stop is one no building ever finishes — so the
 * reading starts by granting nothing and grants a value only where one is shown. Each round bounds
 * the values built in one more step than the last, and where nothing moves, nothing further can be
 * built.
 *
 * <p>Two kinds of place, told apart because only one of them needs the rising. Declarations written
 * in terms of each other are answered together and their answers are rounded to the counts some rule
 * asks about, which is what makes the rising stop. Everywhere else the order of the declarations
 * settles the answers one at a time, and nothing is rounded: a sum of two values is two, and rounding
 * it up to the next count anybody asked about would leave a set drawing on it unable to say it is too
 * small.
 *
 * <p>The bottom the rising starts from is not an answer and never becomes one. A member the rising
 * has not finished with is at the bottom in {@link Answers}, and a reading resting on one of those is
 * a reading resting on an assumption: writing it down as a proof would have {@code A} shown to have
 * no value because {@code B} has none and {@code B} because {@code A} has, which shows neither.
 * What is true once the rising stops is that the least fixed point was reached with those members
 * still at nothing, so no value of any of them is built in finitely many steps — and that is
 * {@link Emptiness.NoBaseInComponent}, written here and nowhere else.
 *
 * <p>This says nothing about which declaration is at fault for an answer of none. That is a question
 * about the graph rather than about any one type, and it is asked of these answers rather than while
 * they are found.
