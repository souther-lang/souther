/**
 * A position's type, read once: what it is, and what it is written as.
 *
 * <p>The two are not the same question and were being answered by whoever needed them. A
 * {@code data StageN = Stage} is a sum — its values are the sum's cases under a name — and it is
 * written {@code StageN(Prospecting)}. The reader that drew a line on it read through the name; the
 * reader that asked what it divides into stopped at the name; and the position came back as one the
 * model does not divide, which is the opposite of what the declaration says (issue #631).
 *
 * <p>So the interpretation happens here and nowhere else:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #shape} is what the position <em>is</em>, with every name off. A reader answering
 *       every case of a {@link Shape} has answered every kind of position, which switching on
 *       {@link Type} does not achieve — {@code Type.Ref} is one constructor for four things.
 *   <li>{@link #wrappers} is what the position is <em>written as</em>: the names a value wears,
 *       outermost first. A representative is built by putting them back on, and an observation is
 *       read by taking them off. Both directions stay available because nominality is the point of
 *       a newtype — {@code StageN(Prospecting)} is what the row writes, and {@code Prospecting} is
 *       what classifies it.
 *   <li>{@link #declared} is the type as the signature wrote it, for anything that reports the
 *       position back to an author.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>A reader does not re-decide any of this.</b> Asking {@code symbols.declarations().declaration(ref.name())} again
 * to find out whether a name is a newtype is the defect this exists to remove, not a shortcut around
 * it.
 *
 * @param declared the type the signature wrote
 * @param wrappers the newtype names worn over {@link #shape}, outermost first; empty for a type
 *                 written under no name of its own
 * @param shape    what the value is, with those names off
