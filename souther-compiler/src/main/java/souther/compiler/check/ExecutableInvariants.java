/**
 * What a value of a declared data is made of and what must hold of one, elaborated once.
 *
 * <p>The reading that runs. A clause used to be typed here and elaborated again by whatever ran it,
 * which put the last step of deciding what a clause means inside a backend (issue #81, ADR-0021);
 * what comes out of here is what the check holds the clause to and what a construction is refused
 * by.
 *
 * <p>Every clause that applies, and not the ones this declaration wrote. An include carries the
 * clauses of what it takes in, and they are checked where the value is built — over the fields that
 * data has, each read through the binding the declaration that wrote it gave
 * ({@link TypeOps#fieldBindings}). So the unit is the data being built and not the declaration a
 * clause was written on: an answer keyed by where a clause was written would be short exactly the
 * clauses a construction has to satisfy.
 *
 * <p>And every one of them comes out of one derived world. What a clause states depends on the
 * representation its declaration is read in — a helper the declaring module expanded is still a
 * call in the form resolution left, under a name that means nothing where this stands — while what
 * a clause is called and where it was written do not. This is the reading that runs, so it is the
 * settled form it wants, and the world it asks is the one that has it.
