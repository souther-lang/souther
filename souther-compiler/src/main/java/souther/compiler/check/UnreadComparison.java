/**
 * Why a comparison naming a position did not become a line.
 *
 * <p>One rule, asked by every reader that has to say so. A {@code guard}'s comparison and an
 * invariant's clause are two producers of one kind of evidence (spec §example-partition), and what
 * stopped each of them is the same fact about this compiler — so a reader of either is told the
 * same thing (ADR-0090). Written twice, the two came apart at once: {@code x < y + 1} was a
 * comparison between two positions where a body wrote it and a form nobody could read where a
 * declaration did, which sends an author after two different pieces of work for one shape.
 *
 * <p>How a position is looked up stays with each reader, exactly as it does in {@link Relates}. One
 * asks what a body's read of a parameter names, the other asks what a clause's coordinate is
 * called; neither is the other's business. What is here is what the answers come to, which is the
 * part that has to agree.
 *
 * <p><b>Two questions, and which of them is asked turns on whether there is a quantity.</b> Where
 * the arithmetic reached one, the quantity is what the rule is about: it says what the rule leaves
 * and, through {@link #filedAt}, which of the places the walk met are the rule's at all. Where the
 * arithmetic stopped there is no quantity to be about, so each place is asked for itself and the
 * reader says what filing there means ({@link RuleAt}).
 *
 * <p>So no answer here is read off a side of the comparison. One was: the reason was worked out
 * once from whichever side named a position, and every place the comparison mentioned was handed
 * the result — after which a rule about {@code n} told {@code l1.l2.leaf} what {@code n}'s carrier
 * carries, and a position the canonical form had cancelled was told a form nobody could read
 * stopped at it.
 *
 * <p>What a position is called travels with the answers and is never read here, only compared with
 * another of its own. So the readers may hold a position under whatever name each of them uses and
 * still be held to one rule.
