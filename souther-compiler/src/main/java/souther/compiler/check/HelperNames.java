/**
 * How a definition is named outside the module that declares it, and what a body carries out of the
 * module it was written in.
 *
 * <p>A reader writes an imported value or helper bare, and the pair (module, name) is what it
 * denotes. Writing the qualified spelling into the tree settles the name a reader reaches it by, so
 * everything downstream — the table a call is expanded against, the method a recursive helper is
 * emitted as — asks and answers with one name, and two modules publishing a {@code tally} stay two
 * entries. Every rewrite here reads what a name denotes and never how it was spelled, so running one
 * twice says what running it once said.
 *
 * <p>What that spelling settles is the reach name, and it is not the declaration's identity. The two
 * coincide for a helper another module published and part ways for the standard library, which is
 * reached under an alias: {@code List.foldFrom} is declared in {@code souther.list}, and no reader of
 * the name can get there from it. Which module declared a definition is carried on the declaration
 * ({@link Hir.FnDef#declaredIn}), and every rule about the declaring module reads it there.
 *
 * <p>The marks a construction carries belong here for the same reason. What a published body builds
 * is built where that body was written; expanding it puts the construction in the reader's body,
 * where nothing left in the tree would say otherwise. The mark is what says so, and it is written
 * where the name is.
 *
 * <p>Nothing here reads a helper table or writes a binding: these are questions about names, and the
 * answers are the same whichever module is asking.
