/**
 * Holds what is declared of the language's operations to what the library declares, and answers
 * with the facts as bound.
 *
 * <p>A fact names an argument of an operation, and what an operation's arguments are is the
 * library's to say. Where the two disagree there is nothing to be done at a call — the fact is
 * about an argument that is not there, or is not the kind of thing the fact is about — so it is
 * said before any call is read rather than met as a missing answer at whichever reader arrives
 * first.
 *
 * <p><b>The one reader of the authoring vocabulary below the declarations, and the one place an
 * {@link ArgumentRef} becomes a position.</b> Everything below the binding holds a
 * {@link BoundOperationFact}, in which every operation is a {@link DeclaredOperation} and every
 * argument a {@link DeclaredArgument}; what those are made of — a word, a name, a signature, what
 * {@link Combinators} says an operation hands its closure — is read here and nowhere after.
 * {@code OnlyTheBinderReadsTheAuthoringVocabularyTest} counts that.
 *
 * <p><b>Over the declarations and not over what a reader asked for.</b> Bound one fact at a time as
 * it was looked up, a fact nothing looked up was a fact nothing checked, and how much of the
 * declaration was validated depended on which consumers a compilation happened to have. This walks
 * the whole list, so a fact declared is a fact held to the library whether or not anything reads
 * it.
 *
 * <p><b>Each declaration read once, before the switch.</b> The operation a fact is about is read
 * against the library into a {@link CompleteSignature} for every declaration, outside the switch,
 * and every arm is handed that reading. So being declared is what holds a fact to the library
 * rather than being a kind that happens to name an argument, and no arm reads the operation a
 * second time to ask where an argument is.
 *
 * <p><b>The switch is an expression.</b> Every arm yields the bound fact its kind comes to, so a
 * kind of fact added to the declarations is a kind that does not compile until this says what it
 * is once bound — an empty arm was how a kind went through held to nothing, and there is no empty
 * arm in an expression.
 *
 * <p>The second way into {@link CompleteSignature#ofDeclaration} beside {@link Preserved}, and on
 * the same warrant: a library declaration, read whole. {@code Preserved} is what a representation
 * keeps standing, which is a policy about representations and not about which operations the
 * library has, so a fact about an operation nothing keeps standing could not borrow its reading
 * from there.
