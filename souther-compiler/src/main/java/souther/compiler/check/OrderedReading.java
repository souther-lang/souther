/**
 * The clauses reaching a value, read for where each of its positions stops.
 *
 * <p>Beside the reading that turns those same clauses into bounds for the report, and beside the one
 * that reads them for which values a position may hold — over the same list, at the same moment.
 * Which clauses reach a value is settled once, by the walk that gathers them; what each reading
 * makes of a clause is its own.
 *
 * <p><b>Leaves, and not the connectives over them.</b> What a conjunction or a choice of these
 * comes to is asked where both languages are held together and where the choices of a declaration
 * are decided ({@code StatedByClauses}), because a branch nobody can be in is settled by things
 * neither language holds alone. Answered here as well, that would be a second place deciding what
 * a choice does to the ranges, and a branch would be dropped only where the ranges were also what
 * could show it impossible — leaving {@code s < "" || (b == true && b == false)} a choice whose
 * every branch some language refused and neither refused alone.
 *
 * <p><b>Why it is not the interval algebra.</b> That one carries one number per position and relates
 * positions to each other by differences, which is worth having and is available only where a model
 * adds and subtracts — so it holds an {@code Int} and a {@code Decimal} and nothing else. This holds
 * every order there is and relates no two positions. Both may read one rule about an {@code Int},
 * and neither is the other's copy: what each can show is its own.
 *
 * <p><b>Why it is not the value sets.</b> Those name which values a position may take, as a finite
 * set or a finite exclusion, and an ordering names no finite set — there are as many dates below a
 * date as anyone likes. Pushing orderings into them would make one finite-set evaluator answer for
 * enum equality, enum ordering, numeric ordering and date ordering at once, which is four readings
 * wearing one name.
 *
 * <p><b>Every range this puts on a position is inside what the order holds.</b> Not an unbounded
 * range narrowed at the end: what is below the empty string is nothing, and a reading open below
 * would take {@code value < ""} for a rule leaving room underneath. The extent is the carrier's
 * ({@link Carrier#extent}) and it is applied where a rule becomes a range, which is the one place
 * a position is spoken about.
 *
 * <p>Applied there and not once around the whole reading, because whether an <em>alternative</em>
 * admits anything is asked of each branch. A branch left short of the order's own ends is a branch
 * whose emptiness nothing can see, and the choice between two such branches then turned on whether
 * they happened to be empty at the same position: {@code a < "" || a < ""} was refused and
 * {@code a < "" || b < ""} was not.
 *
 * <p><b>An equality places both ends and a disequality places none, and both are read.</b> An
 * equality states both at once, which is a range with one value in it and is exactly what this
 * holds; {@code /=} states neither, and the values a denial leaves are a set rather than a range —
 * which is the whole of what such a rule does to a range and is an answer, not a reading that
 * stopped. Under a denial the two swap places, which is the same rule read once.
 *
 * <p>Told apart from a rule this has no word for by {@link #gaveUpAt} and never by the ranges: both
 * leave every position where it was, and reading that back as "nothing was read here" is what made
 * every denial written beside a bound into a choice this reading declined to speak for.
