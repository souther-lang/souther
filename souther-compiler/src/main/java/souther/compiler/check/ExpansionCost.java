/**
 * How many alternatives reading a clause as a union of products would come to, counted before any
 * of them is built.
 *
 * <p>A budget has to be measurable before the work it limits, and the number of alternatives a
 * clause really comes to is not: finding that out is the expansion this is asked to bound. So what
 * is counted is the syntax. A choice adds, a conjunction multiplies, a denial swaps the two, and
 * anything else is one.
 *
 * <p>Duplicates are not refunded. {@code A || A || B} costs three, though a reading of it holds two
 * alternatives: telling that it holds two takes the normalisation whose cost this stands in for.
 * What is promised is an upper bound on what a reading will build, and never the count itself.
 *
 * <p><b>Counted on the fold that does the reading, and not by a walk of its own.</b> Which shapes
 * are connectives, where a denial goes and what is left as a leaf are {@link ClauseReading}'s. A
 * second walk stating that again is a second answer, and the two agree only until somebody changes
 * one of them. Read as a {@code ClauseReading<Integer>} the recursion is the same code, so a shape
 * added to the reading is one this counts by the same act.
 *
 * <p>What comes apart there is not a wrong number. It is a declaration admitted under a budget it
 * then expands past, which is the dynamic widening the domain is chosen before the fold to avoid.
 *
 * <p>The count saturates at one past the limit it was asked about. Past that the number is not
 * wanted — what is asked of it is whether the limit is exceeded — and a conjunction of choices
 * leaves the range of a count long before it leaves the range of what an author can write.
