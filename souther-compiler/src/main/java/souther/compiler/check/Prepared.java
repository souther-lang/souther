/**
 * The module a check and a codegen run over: its imported names written as the definitions they
 * denote, and the helpers its artifact must carry taken on as its own definitions.
 *
 * <p>Two things and one reason. A name an import brought in is written qualified because that is the
 * spelling the table a call expands against is keyed by, and a definition is taken on because the
 * class this module emits has to hold a method for it. What is taken on is not one kind of thing: a
 * recursive helper another module declared, which cannot be inlined into whoever calls it, and a
 * definition minted here for what a row writes at a position, which has no call site to be inlined
 * into. They arrive for different reasons and leave as the same list, because every reader of it —
 * the expansion table, the check, the backend, the fixture reader — wants the same thing of them,
 * which is that the artifact carries them. Which of the two one is, the definition says
 * ({@link Hir.FnDef#role}).
 *
 * <p>Scoped to the module and not to an output. The classes are emitted once per module
 * ({@code Output.Classes}), and every example row attached to it — from its own file and from every
 * {@code examples for} file naming it — runs against those classes. So what is emitted for a row is
 * emitted over all of them, and which rows are reported on is a question asked later, by
 * {@code Output.Examples}, which carries the source file in its key. A state that took one would be
 * pulling an output's concern up into what the module is.
 *
 * <p>What it holds is parts and not a tree. Each route out of it answers with the state of the part
 * it is for, and the projection writes those back into the shape a whole-module pass takes. The
 * other way round is what this rung used to be: the rungs below answered per declaration and per
 * definition, the assemblies poured the answers into an {@link Hir.Module}, and from here there was
 * nothing left to hand over but nodes.

     * definitions minted for its rows are beside it and are in no tree, so two states whose trees
     * compare equal can still say different things about the rows. They do, and without touching the
     * source: a row's operand is wrapped in the type the position it stands at contributes, and that
     * position comes from a behavior's signature — which an edit to an imported module can change
     * while this module's text stays as it was.
     *
     * <p>A state is a query's answer, and a store decides whether anything downstream has to be
     * asked again by comparing the answer it recomputed with the one it held. An answer that leaves
     * out what it answers with is one the store cannot tell has changed.
     *
     * <p>The correspondence between an operand and its method is left out on purpose: it is keyed on
     * operand identity, over the very nodes the tree hands out, so it says nothing a tree and the
     * definitions built from it do not already say.
