/**
 * What a declaration says, published for a reader in another module.
 *
 * <p>A declaration is already a cut at the module boundary: a reader elsewhere asks for the
 * declaration it names rather than for the module-wide answer it came from. What it says and where
 * it is written are two facts about it, both real and each with readers of its own, and a reader
 * across the boundary means the first. Carried across as the authored tree, the second goes with it
 * — every node of one holds where it was written, so a declaration moved down its file says nothing
 * different and arrives as a declaration that changed.
 *
 * <p><b>Not a projection of {@link Normalized.Def}.</b> The normalized declaration is the authored
 * tree after the constructions in its clauses are written as constructions, and it keeps its
 * positions because the passes below it walk it and report from it. This is a different thing to
 * say, not a filtered version of that one: what goes in is what a module reading somebody else's
 * declaration observes, and a component the tree gains later belongs here only if a reader elsewhere
 * would mean it. Adding one is publishing something, and adding it here silently is what a mirror
 * would do.
 *
 * <p><b>Which kind it is, is what it says.</b> A reader elsewhere asks whether a declaration is a
 * product, a sum or a unit far more often than it asks anything else, so the kinds are the sum
 * rather than a tag beside one field list.
 *
 * <p>Where the declaration is written is answered beside this and never from it, the way
 * {@link ClauseLocations} answers where a clause is: they are two facts about one declaration, and a
 * reader that needs both asks for both under the one address rather than finding the declaration
 * twice.
