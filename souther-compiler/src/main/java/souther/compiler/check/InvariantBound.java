 * <p>Read off the comparison. What a report measures a position at is where the rules about it stop,
 * and that is not the same question as which runtime check the rule becomes: the runtime states a
 * decimal above zero directly and has no word for a decimal above five, so a reader written for it
 * answers "no bound" to a rule that plainly draws one. Asked here of an ordering of
 * {@code value} against a literal, and of one end at a time. An equality states both ends at once
 * and is not read: it was not read before either, and giving a position one value is a different
 * answer from bounding it, which the report has nowhere to put yet.
 *
 * <p>Over whole numbers a strict comparison names the adjacent value, and the end lands on a value
 * the rule admits. Over decimals there is no adjacent value, so the end stays on the literal and says
 * that the literal is not one of its own.
