 * established where the statements are ({@link FieldDomains}); what is done here is narrowing that
 * to one number of one position and dropping the lines. A reading of its own here would be a second
 * account of what the rules say, free to answer about fewer of them than the author wrote.
 *
 * <p>A range, and only what a range can hold. What the rules leave out between their ends is not
 * here — a caller asking whether some particular value is admitted is asking the domain the rules
 * seed ({@link FieldDomains#mayHoldNothingAt}) and not this.
