/**
 * The type of the number one of the language's operations answers.
 *
 * <p><b>The one entry, so that a caller never assembles this itself.</b> Two things have a say — the
 * library's signature and the shape of what it answers — and a caller that took the result type as
 * it stands would be right for every operation until the first that answers its number inside a
 * union, and wrong there without saying so.
 *
 * <p>Read by three kinds of reader and owned by none of them: what puts an operation in range of a
 * question ({@link Question}), what holds a declared fact to the signature it is about
 * ({@link DischargeRules}), and what lists the representations reading a number
 * ({@link NumericReadings}). Answered inside any one of them, the other two borrow a consumer's
 * answer, and a reader that would rather not borrow writes a second answer — which agrees with the
 * first everywhere except a union, where nothing brings the two together to disagree.
 *
 * <p>What this is for is the carrier of a term standing for such an answer. What a number is
 * measured by follows from what the number <em>is</em>, and what it is is declared by the operation:
 * {@code String.length} and {@code Time.hour} both answer an {@code Int} and step by one, at
 * positions that step by a character and by a second. Taken from the position the operation was
 * applied at instead, the step of the answer was the step of the argument — a line at the twelfth
 * hour drawn at the twelfth second — which is a boundary sharpened onto a value the term never
 * takes (#1027).
 *
 * <p>Here rather than beside the declarations because reading a signature is the frontend's. A fact
 * is a proposition about an operation and is declared where those are; what the library was written
 * to declare is read where the library is read.
