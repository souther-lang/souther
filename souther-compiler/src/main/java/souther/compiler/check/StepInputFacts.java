/**
 * What holds of everything a reduction's step is handed besides its accumulator, whatever the
 * container holds and however far the walk has got.
 *
 * <p>Plural, and rooted. A step is handed the accumulator and everything else the operation applies
 * it to, and that is not one value: {@code Map.fold} hands its step a key and a value, and the two
 * are bounded by different declarations. So this is facts about places, each rooted at the parameter
 * it arrives on, rather than a range for "the element" — and every parameter but the accumulator is
 * read, so a key is read the day a step is written over one.
 *
 * <p>What holds of an element is not decided here either. {@link UniversalElementFacts} answers that
 * of the container the walk is over, by the path under an element each bound is about, and this
 * instantiates those paths at the place the element arrives — so a fold over a list and an
 * accumulation over the same list are bounded by one reading, and a fold reads what a
 * {@code List.map} upstream of it kept without having met the closure that built it. What a
 * parameter that is not an element guarantees is the same reading asked of that parameter's own
 * type: a key a {@code Map.fold} hands its step is bounded by its declaration and by nothing about
 * what the container holds.
 *
 * <p>Neither is what a value of a type guarantees. {@link InvariantChecker#seedFields} is what
 * decides it, and both readings above project that one answer — the same projection
 * {@link FieldDomains} makes of the same reading. Decided here instead, only a numeric newtype's own
 * rules would have been found: a record's own invariant bounds its fields, and
 * {@code data Line = { amount: Int } invariant amount >= 0} says nothing about any type
 * {@code DeclaredBounds} would have been asked about. That fact is one the walk into a combinator's
 * closure already has ({@link InvariantChecker#walkCall} enters the element and seeds it), so
 * deciding it a second way here would have been two answers to one question, differing by which of
 * them a reader happened to ask.
 *
 * <p>Bounds and not relations. Two places under one parameter may stand in a relation the
 * declaration states — {@code end >= start} — and the projection drops it, as {@link FieldDomains}'
 * does. That is a narrowing of what can be proved and is written down as one: a reduction whose step
 * needs such a relation gets no bound rather than a wrong one.
 *
 * <p>What is here holds of <em>every</em> value the step is handed, so it may be assumed of the one
 * value the step is read against. Nothing that holds of some elements belongs here: a guard about
 * one element of a list says nothing about the element the walk is at, and putting it here would
 * make the induction prove something no walk establishes.
