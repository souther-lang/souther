/**
 * Every value a type has, where they can be counted out at all.
 *
 * <p>Asked so that a rule saying which values a position may not hold can be read as the values it
 * may. {@code /= true} beside {@code /= false} leaves nothing where the values are two and leaves
 * almost everything where they are strings, and the whole of that difference is this answer.
 *
 * <p>Not {@link Carrier}, which answers whether a position has an order-preserving count. The two
 * questions come apart at both ends: a boolean has no order and has two values, a string has an
 * order and has no end of them. They are asked apart here as well as answered apart — nothing below
 * reads that one — so a change to which types carry an order leaves this where it was.
 *
 * <p>Exhaustive over the primitives, so one added to the language is answered here rather than
 * falling to whichever arm this happened to end with. Where the values cannot be counted out the
 * answer is nothing at all, which is what leaves a rule about them saying only what it excludes.
