     * they are written in for that reason alone.
     *
     * <p>Reaching is not only writing the name. A value reaches another by reading it and by
     * calling a helper that reads it — the two kinds of edge {@link ValueCycles} follows together,
     * for the same reason: a body's expansion goes through the helpers it calls, so what is behind
     * one is reached exactly as a name written outright is. Following only the first would leave a
     * chain written through helpers settling in the order it was declared, and a chain written
     * bottom to top copied again per link.
     *
     * <p>Every declaration is a node, a helper as much as a value, because a helper is what carries

     * <p>A cycle has no such order, and there is none to find: {@link ValueCycles} refuses a value
     * that reaches itself before a body of this module is expanded, and a cycle of helpers alone is
     * a recursion the language allows. Either way its members are left in the order they were
     * written, each copying the other, which is the answer this pass gave before there was an order
