/**
 * Which representations read the number an operation answers, and how many of them there are.
 *
 * <p>Three sentences say what this is for, and each of them is a decision somebody will want to
 * undo:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>This describes facts, not precedence. There is no first arm and no fallback: an operation
 *       carrying two accounts of its number gets two, and choosing between them here would be a
 *       fifth account nobody declared.
 *   <li>{@link Resolution.Multiple} is an invalid library definition, not a choice to resolve. What
 *       it means is that two representations would each read one call and which of them a report
 *       showed would be whichever reader arrived. Nothing recovers from it.
 *   <li>{@link Resolution.None} is valid globally; a question may make it invalid within its range.
 *       Most of the library answers numbers nothing reads, and that is ordinary. Where a check
 *       needs a reading, it is that check's range that says so and its silence
 *       ({@code BoundOperationFact.SaysNothingOf}) that is the other answer.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The third is the one worth keeping. Made to answer {@code One} wherever a number is answered,
 * this would start carrying the deliberate silences — {@code String.toInt} answers a number at one
 * case of a union and no representation reads it there — and finding out what is declared would be
 * deciding what ought to be. Made to refuse {@code Multiple} only where some question asks, the
 * exclusivity would hold as far as that question's range and no further, and would move when the
 * range moved.
 *
 * <p><b>Counted, and not asked one representation at a time.</b> Written as a condition per
 * representation inside whatever holds a declaration, a representation added is one every existing
 * representation has to be told about, and the pair nobody writes down is the pair that goes
 * unchecked. Counted here, an account added is one arm on {@link NumericReading} and one line here,
 * and every pair it makes with an existing arm is refused without being named.
 *
 * <p><b>Over the bound facts.</b> What is counted is what the binding made, so the readings an
 * operation has are read off the same values every other reader holds. The binder asks this of the
 * facts it has just bound, before it publishes them ({@code OperationFactBinder}), and a question
 * about the range asks it of the published ones ({@link Question}); both are the one procedure over
 * one vocabulary.
