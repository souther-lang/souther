/**
 * A term read for what it says, with where it stands not among the questions it answers.
 *
 * <p>A term says what it says wherever in a file it stands, but the tree carries where: the position
 * each node was written at, the ordinal the module numbered its constructs from one end with, and
 * the same of the names inside. Both move when anything above the declaration is edited, so a blank
 * line makes every term below it a different tree. A reader that depends on what a term says would
 * be recomputed by an edit the term cannot see.
 *
 * <p>So this is what such a reader depends on. It holds the term the declaration was read into —
 * whose places are the ones the author wrote, and are true — and answers {@code equals} without
 * reading them. Nothing here gives the term back. A value that could be unwrapped would be a value
 * two of which compare equal and can then be told apart, which is what {@link
 * souther.compiler.query.Db} keeps answers from being: what {@code equals} says is what stops the
 * work downstream, so an answer says what it means and not where it came from.
 *
 * <p>Held rather than rewritten. A term with its places taken out is a term that says it was written
 * nowhere and, where it is a fork, that it stands in the body as the author wrote it — answers
 * about a term that nothing asked and nothing can check. What is wanted is not a term missing its
 * places but a reading that does not have them to give.
 *
 * <p>The two operations a caller does with what a declaration states are here, because they are the
 * two that may cross this. Substituting the call's arguments in answers one of these again, so a
 * reading stays a reading however far it is carried; reading it as an assumption goes to
 * {@link Predicates}, which is where every other reading of a term goes.

     * could read a place off it.
     *
     * <p>What holds the rest is not a ledger. It is that nothing the reading publishes carries a
     * tree or a place: what a body is checked against comes back as what the clauses state, and
     * where a clause is written is asked of the thing that says where a clause is written
     * ({@link ClauseLocations}). That is a fact about answers rather than about calls, so it is
     * held by asking the answers — a reading of one source is the same reading whichever compile
     * built the terms it was told about
