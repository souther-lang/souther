/**
 * How much of what a behavior declares the check can read, rule by rule, and which of the answer's
 * cases nothing is said about.
 *
 * <p>The same classification a data's clause gets ({@link ClauseDischarge}), asked of the other kind
 * of clause. It is the same question: what the clause owes, and how much of it this compiler could
 * carry into a form a guard can be held against ({@link StaticReading}). What follows from the answer
 * differs — an invariant's classification says what discharges a construction, a rule's says how much
 * of the relation is there to be read at a call — but what is being asked of the expression is one
 * thing, and asking it twice would be two answers to keep agreeing.
 *
 * <p>The unit is the rule, and under it the conjunct. A rule is already specialized to one case, so
 * {@code ensures Todo | NotFound -> value.id == id} is classified once for {@code Todo} and once for
 * {@code NotFound} and the two may differ — what {@code value} is differs between them, and what the
 * check can make of a statement about it follows. A flat list per behavior would put the two under
 * one entry and leave a reader to work out which case it was looking at.
