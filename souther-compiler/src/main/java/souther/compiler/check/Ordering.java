/**
 * How the values of a type are ordered: whether they are ordered at all, and by what.
 *
 * <p>These were two questions with one answer between them. Whether a type is ordered was a
 * {@code boolean}, and how to compare its values was worked out again at each of the four places
 * that emit a comparison — the operator, the sort family, the {@code sortBy} key, and the
 * {@code compareTo} a newtype carries. Four derivations of one fact disagree the way three did over
 * whether a {@code Date} is a carrier (see {@link Carrier}), and here the disagreement was silent:
 * {@code data StageN = Stage} was refused by {@code <} while its generated class declared
 * {@code Comparable<StageN>} and threw {@code IncompatibleClassChangeError} on the first Java reader
 * that compared two (issue #856).
 *
 * <p><b>Built from the spine, not from the base.</b> {@link TypeOps#base} answers what is left when
 * the names are off and drops how it got there, and a reader that then asks the next question of the
 * type as written is the defect this closes — it is what {@code BinaryElaborator} and the
 * {@code ORDERING} row of the old capability table both did, on the line after they computed the
 * base. So this reads {@link TypeOps#newtypeSpine} once and keeps both halves of its answer: the
 * terminal says what the order is, and the layers say whether a name is worn over it. Nothing here
 * asks a second time whether something was a newtype.
 *
 * <p><b>Sealed, so an order added is one every reader has to answer for.</b> The switches over these
 * four are what makes a fifth a build failure rather than a comparison emitted as an equality test.
 *
 * <p>The rules are ADR-0047 (a single-value newtype is compared by the value it wraps) and ADR-0069
 * (an enumeration is ordered by the order its cases are declared in, and that order lives on the sum
 * because one unit data may be a case of two sums). Composing them is what makes a newtype over an
 * enumeration ordered: {@code Ordered(Newtype<T>) = Ordered(T)} and {@code Ordered(Enumeration)},
 * so {@code Ordered(Newtype<Enumeration>)}.
