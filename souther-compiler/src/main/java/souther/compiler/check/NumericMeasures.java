/**
 * The standard-library operations that count what a location holds, and the reading that finds a
 * number taken of one wherever it is written.
 *
 * <p><b>Two questions and two sets, since #1027.</b> Counting what it is given is one account of
 * what an operation takes of the one value it is given, and {@link #calls()} and {@link #isMeasure}
 * hold that narrow set: what an emptiness check means, what bounds how many a generated container
 * holds, what a clause of a value has a word for. {@link #takenIn} asks the wider question — is this
 * call a number taken of one location at all — and answers for every operation that declares an
 * account of any kind. Asked the narrow question where the wide one was meant, a guard on anything
 * but a size drew no line and nothing said so.
 *
 * <p>Neither set is enumerated here, and neither was. Both are read off the declarations, which is
 * what this class was made for the first time it happened.
 *
 * <p>Which they are is declared with the rest of what is true of the language's operations
 * ({@link OperationFacts}) and read from there. This once held the list
 * itself, which is what made it the first fact promoted out of a check when a second reader wanted
 * it — two lists of the same operations disagreed, and a rule discharged in one place was reported
 * in the other as a rule the model does not state.
 *
 * <p>What is here is what reading one takes: a type in a compilation's symbols, and a call. A partition reading an invariant
 * asks what counts the value in front of it, and a partition reading a guard asks whether the call
 * written there is one of these; answered from two places, adding a measure would be read by one of
 * them and not the other — the same drift one size down.
 *
 * <p>Not what the codec reads. {@code InvariantConstraints} maps a clause onto a decoder constraint,
 * which is a question about what Raoh can enforce rather than about what is a number: it has no
 * entry for {@code Set.size}, because a set crosses the boundary as a list and a constraint chained
 * after the mapping that drops duplicates would count the wrong things. That absence is a fact about
 * the decoder and would be wrong to take from here.
 *
 * <p>Held as the names they resolve to rather than as spellings. Two ways of writing a call that
 * reach one operation are one operation, and comparing {@code "String.length"} against a rendering
 * is reading a name back out of its text.
