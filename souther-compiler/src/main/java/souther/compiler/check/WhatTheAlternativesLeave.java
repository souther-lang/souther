/**
 * What each alternative of a choice leaves the positions, and what the two of them leave between
 * them, read as values of the positions' own orders.
 *
 * <p>Three questions of one walk, and none of them is {@link Settlement.Width}'s. The width is a
 * relation over both alternatives and asks whether dropping one would narrow the choice; these ask
 * what a branch leaves, and what the pair leaves. A reader wanting one of these and given the width
 * would be asking about the branch beside the one it is holding.
 *
 * <p><b>Off what the ends leave and never off what some rule mentioned.</b> A position some rule of
 * a branch bounded is not thereby a position the branch holds down: {@code n >= 2 || n <= 0} bounds
 * an {@code Int} twice and leaves it every value it had. Read off which positions were bounded, a
 * choice beside such a branch was told that the branch holds the position down, and a rule with two
 * bounds covering the order was credited with a line nobody draws.
 *
 * <p><b>Two facts of two strengths, and each is taken in the way its own reader spends it.</b> The
 * same written choice stands wherever a conjunction beside it was distributed in, and one copy can
 * hold a position down where another leaves it alone — so what the copies come to is a quantifier,
 * and it is not the same quantifier for both facts.
 *
 * <p>What a branch holds down is a may. Its reader spends the absence — that the branch leaves the
 * position at every value — and an absence has to hold of every copy, so a position any copy held
 * down is kept and the copies are joined. What the choice stops is a must. That reader spends the
 * presence, so a position is kept only where every copy stopped it, and the copies are met: a copy
 * that leaves the position whole is a copy where the choice does not stop it. Either rule used for
 * the other fact publishes what no copy showed.
 *
 * <p>A copy that was no choice is the identity of both, which is what {@link #fromAChoice} carries.
 * It is not a copy that held nothing down and stopped nothing: nothing there was looked at, and met
 * as though it had been it would take back what every copy beside it showed.
 *
 * <p>Both are associative, commutative and idempotent, which is what keeps the order the copies
 * were met in out of the answer.
 *
 * <p><b>Which copy disagrees with which is reached, and no model turns on it yet.</b> Compiling
 * this repository's own corpus meets copies that differ over what the choice stops, and no reader's
 * published answer changes with them. So the two quantifiers are pinned on this type
 * ({@code WhatOneCopyOfAChoiceLeavesIsNotWhatTheChoiceLeavesTest}) rather than through a model, and
 * what settles each direction is which way its reader can be wrong.
 *
 * <p><b>Of where the orders stop and of nothing else.</b> What a set of values leaves a position is
 * a different question with a different word for "every value", and the reading that asks it
 * answers for its own rules at its own altitude ({@link ReadByClauses.OfARule#narrows}). Held here
 * as well, a branch would be asked whether it holds a position down and answer out of two languages
 * neither of which had read the other's rules.
 *
 * @param mayHoldDownOnLeft  the positions some occurrence of the left alternative holds down
 * @param mayHoldDownOnRight the same for the right
 * @param definitelyStops    the positions every occurrence of the choice stops short of their
 *                           order, which is not what either alternative alone stops: two bounds
 *                           reaching opposite ends of a carrier stop the position on each side and
 *                           leave all of it between them
 * @param fromAChoice        whether any copy this was taken from was a choice at all. A set says
 *                           which positions it holds and never which were looked at, so without
 *                           this an empty one means both "every copy was asked and none of them
 *                           did" and "no copy was ever a choice" — and the readers below spend the
 *                           first as a proof
