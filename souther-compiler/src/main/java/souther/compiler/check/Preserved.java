/**
 * The names the representation being typed keeps standing, and the signature each of them is known
 * by: what the library declared an operation with, and what a value's own check settled it as.
 *
 * <p>Which calls a representation keeps is the representation's to decide
 * ({@link InliningPolicy}), so it is decided once, where that representation is built, and handed to
 * the checker as this. The checker asks only whether this call is one of them: what the operation
 * means to whoever reads the representation — that a {@code List.map} carries a property of every
 * element, that a {@code List.filter} can only lose elements — is that reader's, and typing a call
 * does not depend on anyone having a rule for it.
 *
 * <p>That separation is the point. An operation kept by a representation with no rule about it types
 * like any other and simply states nothing, so being able to type a call and being able to reason
 * about it stay independent. Were the two joined, adding a rule would mean teaching the checker, and
 * a rule missing would mean a program that does not type.
 *
 * <p>What is not here is not kept. A call standing in a representation that keeps none of them, or
 * one this representation never said it would keep, is this compiler having failed to expand it, and
 * is reported as that rather than typed.
