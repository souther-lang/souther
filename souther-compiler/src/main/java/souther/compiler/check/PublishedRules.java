/**
 * The rules that govern a value, as the declarations that wrote them publish them.
 *
 * <p>The pair of {@link ExpandedRules} and the one a reading takes. Both answer which clauses apply
 * to a value and whether the walk that found them was short; they differ in what a clause comes
 * back as. A clause here is what its declaration says it states ({@link ClauseMeaning}), which
 * holds no tree and no place — so a reading built on these is a reading nothing about where the
 * declaration is written reaches.
 *
 * <p>{@link #everyRuleReached} is what a reading turns into the widening it already has a word for.
 * It is not "the reading understood every clause" — a clause published as one this compiler has no
 * form for is reached, and is that reading's own limit to report. It is the narrower claim that
 * nothing was left out before the reading began.

     * The rules that govern a value of {@code named}: the clauses that declaration publishes and
     * the clauses of everything it spreads.
     *
     * <p>Which declarations the walk visits and what each of them states are two authorities with
     * two questions, and neither is asked the other's. What a declaration spreads is that
     * declaration's own answer about itself and is read from what it publishes; whether a name this
     * could not read is one nothing declares at all is the world's, and is the only thing
     * {@code symbols} is asked here.
     *
     * <p>A declaration nothing answered for is rules not reached and not rules there are none of.
     * The two are the same empty list and opposite facts: a declaration that states nothing holds
     * every value its type does, and one whose module nobody could read holds whatever its author
     * wrote. Only where nothing declares it at all are there no rules to be short of — and then
     * there is nothing it spreads to be short of either, which is why the walk stops there.
     *
     * <p><b>{@code found} is what this walk has already worked out, and it is asked at every step.</b>
     * A declaration reached twice is walked once: what governs it does not turn on which of the
     * types that spread it was asked, so a second walk of it is the same walk. It is asked at every
     * step rather than only at the top because a reading walks each declaration it is asked about,
     * and one spread deep in a chain is under many of them.
     *
     * <p>What it is not is a way of counting a clause once. Whether a value can reach one
     * declaration by two paths at all is the language's to say, and it says no: each path brings
     * that declaration's fields with it and the second is refused as a field written twice
     * ({@code TwoSpreadsThatMeetOneDeclarationAreRefusedTest}). So the table is asked twice for one
     * declaration only down one path, where the answer is the same answer — and a language that let
     * the paths meet would be one where this has a question to answer, which is what that check is
     * there to make come back.
     *
     * <p>An entry is written only once the walk under it has come back. A declaration reached twice
     * down one path therefore meets no entry of its own; standing one in for a walk still running
     * would make what a type is held to turn on which of the types in the ring was asked for first.
     * What makes the walk finite instead is the path it is on, which is not the table and is not a
     * rule about declarations either — a declaration that spreads its way round to itself is refused
     * before any reading of it is made ({@link ProductSpreads}), and the cut here is what lets this
     * come back rather than run out of stack if it is ever handed a graph that was not.
