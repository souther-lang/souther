/**
 * Where one reading took a clause in, composed over the clause the way its state is.
 *
 * <p>The same connectives {@link souther.compiler.values.AdmissibleValues} composes its values by,
 * over a different carrier and answering a different question. That one is about the values: which
 * of them may stand at a position, and whether anything left unread is why the answer is as wide as
 * it is. This one is about the rules: which reading took a clause in. A rule that could have
 * narrowed a position and turned out not to be needed is no part of the first answer and is very
 * much part of the second.
 *
 * <p><b>So this has no absorbing element and that one does.</b> A choice one of whose alternatives
 * admits every value at a position admits every value at it, so an unread alternative beside it
 * takes nothing back — which {@code AdmissibleValues.join} reads off the values it arrived at. Here
 * there is nothing to read it off: what is held is where a clause was taken in, not what came of
 * it, and a rule nothing had a word for was taken in by nothing however little the values needed
 * it. Made to agree, this would report a rule as read on the evidence that it did not matter. The
 * two answers are pinned together on one model by
 * {@code ARuleNoAlternativeNeededIsStillOneNobodyReadTest}.
 *
 * <p>So the connectives are not one operation. Under a conjunction, a part nothing could read
 * leaves the parts beside it saying what they said — {@code value >= 1 && f(value)} still bounds the
 * value. Under a choice it need not: a value satisfying the branch nothing could read is under no
 * obligation from the other, so {@code x == 7 || f(y)} says nothing about {@code x}.
 *
 * <p><b>Whether it does is not worked out here.</b> Whether the branch beside an unread one still
 * holds a position down is a question about what the two branches leave, and the answer is the
 * settlement's ({@link Settlement.WidthDependency}); what arrives here is that answer
 * ({@link Opening}), and all this does with it is apply it. Derived from {@link #hasUnreadPart}
 * instead, the rule that comes out is that a branch narrowing a position its neighbour narrows the
 * same way binds nothing there — and two alternatives holding a position to the same values hold it
 * there whether or not either of them could be read to the end.
 *
 * <p><b>So two things are held and they are not mixed.</b> {@link #read}, {@link #settled},
 * {@link #missed} and {@link #hasUnreadPart} are what this reading did with the clause.
 * {@link #opened} is what a choice above it was settled to do to that evidence, and it is contained
 * in what was read — there is nothing to open about a position this clause put no constraint on.
 * Folded into {@code missed}, the two would be one set answering for both, and which of them a
 * reader was being shown would be gone.
 *
 * <p>What is recorded is that the reading settled what the clause does to a position, which is not
 * the same as its having narrowed anything there. A branch shown to admit nothing settles every
 * position it named: the choice is the other branch, so what this clause does to a position only
 * that branch spoke of is nothing at all — an answer, and one only a reading that got to the end of
 * the branch could give.
 *
 * <p>Which is why that answer is not filed as a constraint. A constraint is open to being widened by
 * an alternative nothing could read; "this clause imposes nothing here" is not, since a further
 * choice imposes nothing either. Held as one, whether the answer survived turned on where the
 * brackets fell in a chain of choices — {@code (a || b) || c} and {@code a || (b || c)} are one
 * clause, and a report that reads them differently is reading the tree rather than the rule.
 *
 * <p>Composed rather than collected. A set filled as the leaves go by is a fact about the walk and
 * not about the clause, and it cannot be undone by what a later branch failed to read.
 *
 * @param <A>           what a position is called here. A set algebra and nothing else, so the
 *                      readings' own name for a position is the caller's business
 * @param <L>           which reading this is the account of. Nothing here reads it: what it is for
 *                      is that an answer worked out about one reading cannot be applied to the
 *                      other, which is otherwise the same Java type and composes without a
 *                      complaint ({@link ReadingLanguage})
 * @param read          the positions a part of this clause put a constraint on
 * @param settled       the positions a dead alternative named, which the choice imposes nothing on.
 *                      Not {@link #read}, and this is what keeps the choice associative: a
 *                      constraint can be widened by an alternative beside it, and "this clause
 *                      imposes nothing here" cannot — a further choice imposes nothing extra
 *                      either. Folded into {@code read}, whether it survived turned on where the
 *                      brackets fell
 * @param missed        the positions a part of it was about and this reading could not work out
 * @param hasUnreadPart whether a part of this clause went unread anywhere in it, which is what a
 *                      choice needs in order to ask what its alternatives leave. What that part was
 *                      about is not carried: a branch nothing could read is a branch a value can
 *                      satisfy instead, whichever positions it happens to name
 * @param opened        the positions a choice above was settled to have left open, out of those
 *                      this clause put a constraint on. The one thing here that is not this
 *                      reading's own work, and contained in {@link #read} so that it cannot become
 *                      a second account of what the clause was about
