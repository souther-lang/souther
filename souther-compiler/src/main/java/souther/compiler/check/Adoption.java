/**
 * Where one reading took a clause in, composed over the clause the way its state is.
 *
 * <p>The same connectives {@link souther.compiler.values.AdmissibleValues} composes its values by,
 * over a different carrier and answering a different question. That one is about the values: which
 * of them may stand at a position, and whether anything left unread is why the answer is as wide as
 * it is. This one is about the rules: which reading took a clause in. A rule that could have
 * narrowed a position and turned out not to be needed is no part of the first answer and is very
 * much part of the second.
 *
 * <p><b>So this has no absorbing element and that one does.</b> A choice one of whose alternatives
 * admits every value at a position admits every value at it, so an unread alternative beside it
 * takes nothing back — which {@code AdmissibleValues.join} reads off the values it arrived at. Here
 * there is nothing to read it off: what is held is where a clause was taken in, not what came of
 * it, and a rule nothing had a word for was taken in by nothing however little the values needed
 * it. Made to agree, this would report a rule as read on the evidence that it did not matter. The
 * two answers are pinned together on one model by
 * {@code ARuleNoAlternativeNeededIsStillOneNobodyReadTest}.
 *
 * <p>So the connectives are not one operation. Under a conjunction, a part nothing could read
 * leaves the parts beside it saying what they said — {@code value >= 1 && f(value)} still bounds the
 * value. Under a choice it does not: a value satisfying the branch nothing could read is under no
 * obligation from the other, so {@code x == 7 || f(y)} says nothing about {@code x} either. That is
 * why {@link #dropped} is here and why {@link #either} spoils across positions the unread branch
 * never named — the same reason {@code AdmissibleValues.join} does.
 *
 * <p>What is recorded is that the reading settled what the clause does to a position, which is not
 * the same as its having narrowed anything there. A branch shown to admit nothing settles every
 * position it named: the choice is the other branch, so what this clause does to a position only
 * that branch spoke of is nothing at all — an answer, and one only a reading that got to the end of
 * the branch could give.
 *
 * <p>Which is why that answer is not filed as a constraint. A constraint is open to being widened by
 * an alternative nothing could read; "this clause imposes nothing here" is not, since a further
 * choice imposes nothing either. Held as one, whether the answer survived turned on where the
 * brackets fell in a chain of choices — {@code (a || b) || c} and {@code a || (b || c)} are one
 * clause, and a report that reads them differently is reading the tree rather than the rule.
 *
 * <p>Composed rather than collected. A set filled as the leaves go by is a fact about the walk and
 * not about the clause, and it cannot be undone by what a later branch failed to read.
 *
 * @param <A>     what a position is called here. A set algebra and nothing else, so the readings'
 *                own name for a position is the caller's business
 * @param read    the positions a part of this clause put a constraint on. Open to being widened:
 *                an alternative nothing could read is one a value can satisfy instead, and what
 *                this part said of the position then binds nothing
 * @param settled the positions a dead alternative named, which the choice imposes nothing on. Not
 *                {@link #read}, and this is what keeps the choice associative: a constraint can be
 *                widened by an alternative beside it, and "this clause imposes nothing here"
 *                cannot — a further choice imposes nothing extra either. Folded into {@code read},
 *                whether it survived turned on where the brackets fell
 * @param missed  the positions a part of it was about, or was widened by a part nothing read, and
 *                so was not settled at
 * @param dropped whether a part of this clause went unread anywhere in it, which is what a choice
 *                needs in order to know that a branch widened it. What that part was about is not
 *                carried: a branch nothing could read widens the positions the other branch spoke
 *                about whether or not it names them
