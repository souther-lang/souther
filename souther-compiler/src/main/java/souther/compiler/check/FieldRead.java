/**
 * What a {@code .} written on a value standing at a position may name.
 *
 * <p>The one reading of a field access, and the only place a type is crossed at a {@code .}. What is
 * readable off a value is not what a value of a declaration is laid out as: a sum is laid out as
 * nothing — a value of it is a value of one of its cases — while a name every one of its cases
 * spreads is readable on every value of it. Asked of the layout, a reader is told a shared name is a
 * field nothing declares; asked here, it is told what the language reads there.
 *
 * <p><b>The nominal barrier is here.</b> A name worn over a value is not looked through: a
 * {@code data AmountN = Int} reads its own {@code value} and nothing of the {@code Int}, and a
 * {@code data StageN = Stage} reads no case's field of the sum it names. That is what a {@code .}
 * means and not a policy of whoever is reading — an elaboration, a walk that types what a text
 * wrote, and an editor asking what may follow a {@code .} are one answer, so a reader adding a
 * second decision about the names would be answering a question this has already answered.
 *
 * <p><b>Which world, from the caller, in both halves.</b> Which names are readable is nominal and
 * comes from the declarations ({@link ReadableFields}); what one of them holds is {@code world}'s.
 * An accepted program's fields are what its check settled and a text that has not checked has what
 * its declarations resolve to so far, and neither reader may fall back to the other's answer. The
 * nominal half has the same two worlds and {@code unreadable} is where they part: a declaration
 * that does not read is a thing a check reports and a thing an editor is asked in front of.
 *
 * @param symbols    what the names in a position denote
 * @param world      what a declaration holds under each of its names, in the world this reading is
 *                   being made in
 * @param unreadable what this reading does where the declarations at a position do not read
