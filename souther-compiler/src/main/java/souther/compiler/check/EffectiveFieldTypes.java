/**
 * What each field a declaration reaches holds — the name of a field to the type it holds, over its
 * own fields and the ones its spreads bring in.
 *
 * <p>The closure and not one declaration's fields. A spread brings a field in with the type it was
 * written with, and a reader working that out for itself would be walking the spread declarations
 * again; so the walk is made once and what it came to is the answer.
 *
 * <p><b>A mapping and not a sequence.</b> The order this iterates in is the walk's and is no part
 * of what it answers, so nothing may take it as the order a value lays its fields out in or as the
 * order a declaration writes them. A reader that needs the order asks something that answers it —
 * {@link FieldBindings} numbers a declaration's own fields as it writes them, and how a value is
 * laid out is what builds its shape.
 *
 * <p><b>Types and nothing else.</b> Not where a field is written, not which declaration supplied
 * it, not whether two of them collided. Those are questions about the text of the declarations the
 * walk passed through, and a reader of this one is asking what a value of the type holds — an
 * answer that stays put when a declaration it reached moves.
 *
 * <p>Nothing here reports. A spread naming something that is not a product brings in no field and a
 * name declared twice keeps the one the walk reached last; both are refused where the declaration
 * is checked, against the text that wrote them, and a second refusal from out here would be about a
 * declaration the reader never read.
 *
 * <p>Beside {@link FieldBindings} rather than joined to it. Which binding a field is and what it
 * holds move at different times: a field's type changing leaves every binding where it was.
