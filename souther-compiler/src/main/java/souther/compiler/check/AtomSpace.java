/**
 * The atoms a type is made of: the cases a value of it can be that are not themselves sums.
 *
 * <p>A sum whose case is a sum is transparent as a value — anything of the inner one is of the
 * outer one (spec §sum-data) — so what a value of the outer sum can be is not its case list but
 * what descending that list reaches. That descent is what this is, and it is written once. Four
 * readers used to write it themselves, each keyed on what suited it, and they answered differently
 * where the descent reaches one case twice.
 *
 * <p>An atom here is a <em>case</em> identity and not the atom of {@link Terms} and the numeric
 * readings, which is a term a reading cannot take further apart. The two never meet: this answers
 * what a value may be, and that one names where a value came from. Said because the word carries
 * both in this compiler and a reader arriving at one from the other has to be told which.
 *
 * <p>An atom is one per {@link TypeSymbol}. Two cases naming one type are one atom however many
 * declarations reach it: the type is what a value is, what a codec tags, and what an arm tests, so
 * a reader keyed on anything else counts one thing as two.
 *
 * <p>What comes out is unique and deterministic. Within a declaration it is the order the cases are
 * written in, first reach keeping the place — a derived codec writes its variants in it (spec
 * §sum-discrimination), so an order that came out of whichever collection was reached for would
 * move a generated artifact nothing about the program had changed. An anonymous union holds its
 * members as a set and states no order of its own, so its members are taken in their name's order
 * rather than in the set's: an order nothing decided is one that can differ between two runs of one
 * compiler, which is the same defect from further away.
