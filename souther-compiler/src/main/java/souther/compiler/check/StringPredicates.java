/**
 * A library predicate over a string, as the strings it accepts.
 *
 * <p>The one place a call is read as a set of strings. What {@code String.contains("市", value)}
 * says about the position it names is which strings stand there — the same kind of answer
 * {@code String.matches} gives and the same kind this compiler already knows how to hold, since a
 * language over code points is what {@link souther.compiler.regex} is. Read one spelling at a time
 * instead, {@code matches} was a set of strings and the predicates beside it were forms nothing
 * took apart, so a position an author had written a rule for admitted every string there is — and a
 * value nobody could compose there took its siblings' obligations down with it.
 *
 * <p><b>Keyed by what the operation means and not by how a rule is written.</b> Each entry says
 * which argument carries the position, which carries the text, and what the strings around that
 * text may be. A predicate added to the library is a row here or is named as one this does not
 * answer for ({@code EveryPredicateOverAStringIsReadAsASetOfStringsTest}), so a new one does not become
 * a rule that quietly says nothing.
 *
 * <p><b>One clause, one reading, handed on.</b> What a clause states is worked out once, by the
 * entry point its tree has, and comes back as a {@link Reading} that holds what became of it — the
 * strings, or what stopped the reading short of them. A caller takes that value rather than going
 * back to the clause to establish a second time what it already has: asking twice is one question
 * with two derivations, and the day either the fold or the parser learns a form is the day they
 * part.
 *
 * <p><b>And what it says about a position is nobody's answer here.</b> The strings are a fact about
 * a language. Whether the position those strings stand at is restricted, divided, or left where it
 * was found turns on what the rule is written in, and it is settled by the reading that holds every
 * rule reaching the position — so this hands over the strings and stops. Answered here, the same
 * language would mean one thing under an invariant, whose other side is refused at construction, and
 * another under a behavior, where both sides stand.
 *
 * <p>{@code String.isEmpty} is not here, and is not missing. It is written in the library as
 * {@code String.length(s) == 0} and arrives as that comparison, which is a question about a number
 * and is answered where numbers are.
