/**
 * A fact about an operation, once it has been held to the library that declares one.
 *
 * <p>What {@link souther.compiler.semantics.OperationFacts} states is written in the vocabulary
 * somebody authors a fact in: a {@link souther.compiler.types.ValueName} for the operation it is
 * about, an {@link souther.compiler.semantics.ArgumentRef} for an argument it names, another name
 * for an operation it relates this one to. None of those says the library has such an operation, or
 * that it takes an argument there, or that the two signatures let one stand for the other. That is
 * what {@link OperationFactBinder} settles against {@link souther.compiler.stdlib.Stdlib}, and
 * these are what the facts come to once it has: every operation is a {@link DeclaredOperation} and
 * every argument a {@link DeclaredArgument}, each read against its declaration.
 *
 * <p>A reader below the binding holds one of these and asks nothing further. Handed the authoring
 * value instead, it would have the name and the table and could put the same question again — and
 * would get an answer that agrees with the binder's for exactly as long as nobody changes either.
 *
 * <p><b>One arm per kind of authored fact, and every arm names its operation.</b> The binder's
 * switch over the authoring kinds is an expression yielding one of these, so a kind added there is
 * a kind that does not compile until it says what it comes to bound. The operation is on every arm
 * because that is what the fact is about, and it is the one thing a table of these is keyed by —
 * read off the fact itself, so no key is ever written beside a value that could disagree with it.
 *
 * <p><b>Two families, and every arm is in one of them.</b> {@link OneAboutAnOperation} is a kind of
 * which an operation carries at most one — a second declaration of it would be two answers to a
 * question that has one, and is refused where these are collected. {@link SeveralAboutAnOperation}
 * is a kind an operation states as many of as it states: two bounds are two facts. The family is
 * chosen where the arm is written, so a kind added cannot leave whether it may repeat to whichever
 * collector happens to receive it.
