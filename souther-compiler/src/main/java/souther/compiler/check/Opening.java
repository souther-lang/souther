/**
 * What one choice left open, as one reading measures it.
 *
 * <p>A choice offering an alternative nothing could read leaves the branch beside it holding
 * nothing down at some of the positions it spoke of: a value satisfying the unread branch owes the
 * read one nothing. Which positions those are is a question about what the two branches leave, and
 * it is settled where the branches are ({@link Settlement.WidthDependency}). This is that answer on
 * its way to whoever applies it.
 *
 * <p><b>Two things are owed about it and this holds both.</b> A position has to be told it may be
 * wider than the rules leave it, and an author has to be sent to the choice they wrote. The two are
 * not the same set — a position hears about it only where nothing showed the choice leaves it what
 * it would without the unread alternative, and an author is sent wherever the alternative beside
 * the unread one <em>reached</em> a position, whether or not the answer there turned on it. Both
 * are read off this reading's account of this reading's clause, and holding them apart from one
 * another but together under one {@code L} is what keeps a half of one from being answered with a
 * half of the other's.
 *
 * <p><b>What a member of {@link #positions} says, which is the weaker of the two things it could.</b>
 * A position is there where this reading could not establish that the alternatives leave it what
 * the choice leaves it — not where it established that they do not. So the semantic opening is
 * contained in it and is not it, and the cost of the difference is a reading declining to speak for
 * a position it could have, never an answer handed out as exact when it is not.
 *
 * <p>Stated at the weaker end on purpose. A reading whose descriptions are canonical can answer the
 * question exactly, and one whose descriptions are written more ways than they are meant can only
 * answer it one way round; both belong in the same type, and a contract pitched at whichever
 * reading is sharpest today would have to move the day a third one arrives.
 *
 * @param <A>       what a position is called
 * @param <L>       which reading measured this. A position one reading says a choice left open is
 *                  not a position the other says anything about, and the two answers are the same
 *                  Java type once the tag is dropped ({@link ReadingLanguage})
 * @param positions the positions this reading could not show the alternatives preserve
 * @param byTheLeftGoingUnread  the positions this reading reached in the right alternative, where
 *                              the left is one it had no word for. Empty where it read the left
 * @param byTheRightGoingUnread the same the other way round
