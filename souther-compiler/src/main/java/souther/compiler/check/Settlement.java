/**
 * What settling the met-together reading came to: the values, and the fate of every branch.
 *
 * <p>One computation and two projections of its result. Working {@link StatedTogether} out under an
 * allowance is what decides which values every position admits, and the same work is the only thing
 * that can say whether anybody can be in a branch of a choice — so both come back from it together,
 * as a value, and nothing recomputes either. The account of what each rule took in
 * ({@link StatedByClauses.Reading#accountOf}) consumes the fates; it holds no machinery to decide
 * one.
 *
 * <p><b>A fate is an aggregate over every place distribution put the branch, not an attribute of
 * one place.</b> The same written choice stands inside each branch of every choice met with it, and
 * one copy's branch can admit something where another copy's admits nothing — a branch of {@code B}
 * inside the left of {@code A} is refined by {@code A}'s left, and the same branch inside the right
 * by {@code A}'s right. What the written branch's author can act on is the whole declaration's
 * answer: nobody can be in it only if nobody can be in it anywhere it stands. So the sides join over
 * occurrences by {@link Emptiness#joined}, which is associative, commutative and idempotent — and
 * so is every other component of a side ({@link Sided#alsoSeen}), so the order the copies are met
 * in, and how the conjunctions were bracketed, cannot reach the answer.
 *
 * @param confinement the whole reading worked out — what every position may hold and where its
 *                    order stops — with what could not be built beside it
 * @param outcomes    the fate of both branches of every written choice, by its id

     * for the one case the account needs it: a branch kept without being shown live is kept with
     * the reason nobody knows, or the account would call a position open where the truth is that
     * nothing looked. Read only where the aggregate stays {@link Emptiness#UNDECIDED}; a branch
     * shown live somewhere needs no excuse, and a branch dead everywhere takes its reasons with it.
     *
     * <p><b>Two halves and not one map, because they are routed and not distributed alike.</b> What
     * the answer at a position was short of holds of every rule whose question waited on that
     * answer, so it goes to each of them. What a machine somebody's pattern asked for was refused
     * for holds of the pattern that asked and of nothing else — every rule reaching a position pays
     * into one allowance, so a place cannot say which of them asked, and a half that travelled as a
     * position's reasons was read back as every rule's.
     *
     * <p>So there is no map here holding both. A position's own account is that projection
     * ({@link #asPositionStanding()}) and is made where a position is being described; nothing
     * builds an account of a rule out of it, which is the direction the loss runs in.
