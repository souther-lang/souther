/**
 * The clauses reaching a value, read for where the numbers its operations answer stop.
 *
 * <p>The third reading of one clause tree, beside which values may stand at a position and where
 * the position's own order stops. A rule about how long the string at a place is says nothing about
 * which strings stand there and nothing about where they stop: it is a line on a whole number, and
 * that number is the one it is a line on.
 *
 * <p><b>Leaves, and not the connectives over them</b>, for the reason {@link OrderedReading} gives.
 * What a conjunction or a choice of these comes to is composed where both of the readings that
 * decide a branch's fate are held ({@link Confinement.Planned#either}), so a choice between two
 * bounds on one length settles to what the two of them leave together and a bound in a branch
 * nobody can be in settles to nothing. Read off the leaves alone, a bound written under a
 * {@code ||} would be a bound every value has to meet.
 *
 * <p><b>Only what an operation answers</b> ({@link DerivedNumber}). Where the values at a position
 * stop is the reading of ends' and is settled there; keyed alike, the two would be two mechanisms
 * over one order, and the line a report draws would be whichever of them was asked.
 *
 * <p><b>Which number a leaf is about is not decided here.</b> That is what the leaf states, and it
 * is answered where the arithmetic of the comparison is ({@link StatedLines}) — the same answer the
 * attribution of an end to a conjunct runs on. Asked again here, off which side is spelled as a
 * name, a rule whose coordinate is written inside an expression would be a rule this reading is not
 * about, and the choice above it would come back saying the model draws no line.
 *
 * <p>So this answers one question: whether a range can be read for the number the leaf states a
 * line on. A line it could not place leaves that number where it was and says so
 * ({@link Read.LeftOpen}), because the two are not the same fact — a number no rule spoke of
 * runs as far as it ever did, and one a rule stopped somewhere nobody worked out is a line this
 * compiler owes an answer for.
