/**
 * What declarations already say about the type of a value expression.
 *
 * <p>One walk. Every consumer that needs the question reads this rather than putting declaration-led
 * typing together again: the reading that builds a row, the pass that decides which methods a row's
 * calls need emitted, the measure that asks what a fixture states, and the editor asking what may be
 * written after a {@code .}. Two walks would be two answers about the same declarations, and the one
 * that answered later would find nothing.
 *
 * <p><b>Total over the forms of an expression.</b> Every case of {@link Hir.Expr} is named here and
 * there is no {@code default}, because the two things a {@code default} answered are not one fact: a
 * form nobody wrote an arm for and a form whose type no declaration states both came back as
 * "nothing states this", and no consumer could tell them apart. Naming the forms makes the second a
 * statement — this reading does not join the arms of a {@code match}, and says so — and makes a form
 * added to the language stop the build here instead of quietly widening the first.
 *
 * <p>The same closure over what an application applies. Which declaration a callee names decides how
 * it is read, and the cases of {@link ValueName} are named rather than fallen through.
 *
 * <p>How the evidence flows through an expression is this walk's, and what a {@code .} on a value
 * may name is not. Which names a position makes readable, how far the names it wears come off, and
 * what one of those declarations holds under a name are {@link FieldRead}'s — one reading, the same
 * one an elaboration types a text by. So a caller in a world where the check has settled what a
 * value is made of gets that answer here, the walk cannot reach a second one by reading the
 * declaration itself, and a name every case of a sum spreads is answered for because it is
 * readable, rather than left unanswered because a sum lays out no field of its own.
 *
 * <p>What a declared signature is settled to by what stands at its parameters is not this walk's
 * either: it is {@link SignatureApplication}'s, the step the elaboration takes at every call. A rule
 * of its own here would be a second answer about what a polymorphic declaration answers, and the
 * two would part at whichever forgot a case.
 *
 * <p>Nothing is run. Every step reads a name {@code Resolve} already settled or a declaration a
 * module already made. Reading what an application answers means reading the callee's declaration,
 * and where the callee is a definition of this module's own that means reading its body — once per
 * {@link Specialization} of it, which is what the expansion below already counts as one application.
 *
 * @param facts     what the declarations say about a type, in the world this walk is being made in —
 *                  handed over rather than made here, so which world that is, in both halves of it,
 *                  is settled by whoever is doing the reading and not once per walk
 * @param values    the definitions a body of this module may name, under the name it reaches each of
 *                  them by
 * @param behaviors what a behavior this module can name declares it takes and answers. Required, and
 *                  not defaulted to none: a reader that left it out would answer nothing for a call
 *                  of a behavior that another reader answers for, and two answers about one
 *                  expression is the state this walk exists to remove
 * @param bound     what the bindings in force where the walk starts have to say about themselves.
 *                  Read and not written: a walk enters its own bindings over these rather than into
 *                  them, so what a caller works out once may be handed to every walk it makes
