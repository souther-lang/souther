 * <p>One per operand, taking nothing and answering with the value that operand is. It is emitted
 * beside the module's own methods, into the same generated program, so the value a row supplies and
 * the value the behavior is applied to are the one value: nothing is carried between them and
 * nothing converts one representation into another. That is the whole of what makes this a reading
 * of the language rather than a second one — a row runs its own operand the way the module runs its
 * own body.
 *
 * <p>Which operand a definition belongs to is constructed once, where the definitions are made:
 * {@link Emitted#methods()} pairs each operand with the name its method went under, and the reader
 * that invokes one reads that rather than counting the rows again. A second count would be a second
 * order, and a row would run the operand beside the one it wrote.
