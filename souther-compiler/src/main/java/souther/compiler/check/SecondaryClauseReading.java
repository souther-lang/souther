 *
 * <p>Two readings type a clause here — a declaration's invariant over its fields, and a behavior's
 * rule over its signature — and both used to catch whatever came out of the elaborator and read it
 * as this analysis meeting its limit. What came out included a representation refusing to be built,
 * so a node saying it had come apart and a shape this reading has no rule for arrived alike, and the
 * compile went on with the invariant quietly undischarged.
 *
 * <p>So the limits are named here and everything else goes past. What this reading may stop on is a
 * call its expansion left standing that it has no signature for, and a clause the elaborator refused
 * — and refusing a clause is what the authoritative check does with a program, not something this
 * reading found out. Nothing else is a limit: an {@code IllegalStateException} from a walk, a node's
 * own refusal, a name read through nothing are this compiler disagreeing with itself, and there is no
 * reading of the program under which they are acceptable.
