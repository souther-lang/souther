/**
 * A normalized declaration with the boundary representation derived for it, and the module where
 * every declaration it writes has one.
 *
 * <p>What is established here is the representation and only that: a product data has the decoder
 * and encoder derived from its declared shape, so a reader asking how a value of it crosses is
 * answered rather than left to find out that nothing had worked it out yet. That the constructions
 * in the clauses are constructions was established one rung up ({@link Normalized}), and is what
 * every reader of a declaration gets whether or not a representation could be derived for it.
 *
 * <p>Not the boundary representation in general. What a sum's alternatives are called as they cross
 * is derived where it is read ({@code check.Boundary}) and a unit has none, so the two of them are
 * carried here as the declarations they are and nothing more.
 *
 * <p>Two members and they say different things. {@link Def} is one declaration's answer, and a
 * declaration that has no answer costs the readers that name it and no others. {@link Module} is
 * the conjunction — every declaration the module writes has one — which is what a reader wanting the
 * module rather than a declaration is asking for. A module missing a declaration it writes would be
 * read as one that does not declare it, which is a different thing to say and not a true one.
