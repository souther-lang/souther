 * binder settled it against the declaration — so nothing here interprets a word or reads a
 * signature; what is here is the one step from "argument three of {@code List.take}" to the
 * expression standing there in this call.
 *
 * <p><b>The call has to be a call of the declaration the argument is of.</b> A position is a number,
 * and a number is right in a call of any operation that takes enough arguments — so an argument of
 * {@code List.filter} handed a call of {@code List.map} would answer with whatever stands third in
 * the map, with nothing looking wrong. The argument knows what it is an argument of and the call
 * knows what it calls, and the two are held to each other here, at the one place a position is
 * applied.
