/**
 * What the invariant-discharge check names a value by — the identity two writings of one value
 * share, and the whole of what a fact set knows about which value it is talking about.
 *
 * <p>A value, not a rendering of one. Two terms are the same term when they are built the same way
 * out of the same parts, and that is the only thing that makes them the same. This was a string
 * before, written by concatenating the parts' own strings, and the encoding was not injective: a
 * list of one string element {@code a", "b} and a list of two elements {@code ["a", "b"]} wrote one
 * key, so a guard about the first discharged a clause about the second. Nothing here can spell one
 * value the way another spells itself, because nothing here spells anything.
 *
 * <p>Equality is structural. {@link Terms} hands every term it builds through an interner, so two
 * writings of one value are usually one object and the comparison stops at the first line — but that
 * is an optimisation and not the contract. A term built without going through that interner, or
 * through another one, is equal to its twin all the same, which is what lets one reading be compared
 * against another.
 *
 * <p>The hash is computed once, when the term is built, out of the hashes its parts already carry.
 * A chain of terms is a graph and not a tree — a name read twice is one value read twice — so a hash
 * that walked the parts at every ask would cost what writing the parts out used to cost, which is
 * the thing that made the string form of this hold a name for each shape rather than the shape.
 *
 * <p>Equality of an {@code ==} between two values does not depend on which was written first, so
 * that shape holds its two parts as a pair with no order. Every other shape is ordered.
