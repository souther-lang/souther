/**
 * One thing a rule of the model is answerable for, at one position, written at one place.
 *
 * <p>Three and not two. What a reading was short of and where it left the position short are what a
 * place's own account holds; which written thing it is about is what an account of a rule needs and
 * is what a place cannot say — every rule reaching a position pays into its answer, so a place has
 * as many claimants as it has rules and names none of them.
 *
 * <p><b>Made where the reading decided, and never read back out of a place.</b> A position's
 * standing is what it was left holding and is right to hold every reason there is; sifting it for
 * the ones a rule could be answerable for gives a list of reasons and no rule. So each of these is
 * made at the point the reading made the decision, where the written thing is still in hand, and
 * what travels afterwards is this.
 *
 * <p>Told apart by all three. The same reason at the same position, decided at two written places,
 * is two of these — an author has two things to look at, and a carrier that kept one would be
 * choosing between them by whichever was met first.
 *
 * <p>No order. Which of two of these an author wrote first is a fact about the model, and saying it
 * needs the source rather than the reading; nothing here is in an order anybody may read.
 *
 * @param position what the reading was left unable to say the values of
 * @param why what it was short of, which a rule is answerable for ({@link UnreadReason.About#A_RULE})
 * @param site the written place the reading decided it at
