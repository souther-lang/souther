/**
 * What the clauses of one value say, with every choice in them decided.
 *
 * <p>The other side of {@link StatedByClauses}, which is the same four things while one question
 * about them is still open: whether each branch of a choice is one anybody can take. That question
 * is answered by working the values out, and until it is answered none of the four has its final
 * form — what the positions admit, where they stop, and what each language is recorded as having
 * taken in are all different for a branch that survives and one that does not.
 *
 * <p><b>So the queries that need the answer live here and nowhere else.</b> A caller holding one of
 * these cannot ask about a branch that has not been decided, because there is no such thing to hold.
 * Held on the planned side as well, a reader could ask what a clause adopted before the branch it
 * was in was known to be dead, and the account would name a rule of a branch nothing satisfies —
 * sending an author to look at something that is not there.
 *
 * <p>Working the values out is also what settles which positions this compiler could not build, and
 * that is a second thing the resolved side owes: the account of what a clause adopted is written
 * before any machine is made, so a position whose answer was not built is one it still calls taken
 * in. What arrives here has been given up on at those positions.
 *
 * <p><b>What a rule is answerable for is not read off that.</b> A position says what it was left
 * holding and says it for every reason there is, so filtering its reasons for the ones a rule could
 * be answerable for gives a list of reasons and no rule — every rule that named the place, taken
 * for the one that asked. Which rule asked is carried from where the asking is
 * ({@code OfAPart.aboutARule}, filled by routing a shortfall to the part that asked for the machine
 * it names), and there is nothing here that turns a place's reasons back into an account of a rule.
