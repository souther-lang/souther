/**
 * Which rule of the model, and nothing about how anybody came to be holding it.
 *
 * <p>One answer per way a rule is written. An author writes a rule as a clause of a {@code data}'s
 * invariant, as a comparison in a body, as a predicate applied in a body, as a fork whose condition
 * is none of those, or as a clause of a behavior's {@code ensures}; a question about coverage is
 * raised by one of those, and what answers it is a fact about that rule and not about the reading
 * that reached it. So this is what a question is filed under, and it is the same value however many
 * times the rule is read.
 *
 * <p><b>A comparison and a predicate are two of them and not one "rule of a body".</b> They divide a
 * position differently — one places a line on an order and the other tells a set of values from the
 * rest — and a reader is shown a different construct for each. Held as one arm, the two would be
 * told apart by looking at what the rule turned out to do, which is the thing a key must not be
 * built out of.
 *
 * <p>Nothing here says where a rule was met. A guard inside a helper is read once per call of that
 * helper: the calls are different occurrences, they carry different comparison sites, and they are
 * one rule. Carrying the occurrence, two readings of one rule are two keys — the question would be
 * raised twice and answered twice, which is a reading raising a question rather than the model, and
 * is what a coverage obligation is written against. Where a rule was met is
 * {@link souther.compiler.partition.LineOrigin}'s, beside this rather than inside it.
 *
 * <p>Nothing here says what a rule <em>did</em>, either. Which side of a line the cut value falls
 * on, whether the comparison holds at it, which arms witness it, which declarations took an end in —
 * those are answers about a boundary, they are the same rule's whichever way they come out, and a
 * key holding them files one rule under several.
