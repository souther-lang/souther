/**
 * The rules written about a value, or the fact that a value of this kind has none to write.
 *
 * <p>Two answers that {@link FieldDomains#NONE} reads as one. Its contract is a caller that chose
 * not to read a declaration or had none to read, which is why it says of every position that the
 * reading never reached the rules about it — the safe answer for a caller that stopped, and a false
 * one for a caller that looked at a declaration which can hold no rule. A reader deciding whether
 * the model divides a position needs those apart: told the second as the first, it would answer "a
 * rule about this may have gone unread" of every plain {@code String} in every model, and told the
 * first as the second it would say the model states nothing where nobody looked.
 *
 * <p>Which of the two it is comes from the declaration standing at the position, over
 * {@link Hir.Def} with no {@code default}. That is where the fact lives: an invariant clause is
 * carried by {@link Hir.Data} and by nothing else, and the front end refuses one written on a
 * declaration lowered into another kind (spec
 * §an-invariant-is-declared-where-a-construction-owes-it), so a kind that holds no clauses is a kind
 * nothing was written on. A declaration kind added later stops this compiling rather than arriving
 * as a value quietly said to have no rules.
 *
 * <p>Nothing here reads a {@code Shape}. Which shapes can carry a rule is the declaration world's
 * answer, and a reading of it made out here would be a copy of that kept in step by hand.
