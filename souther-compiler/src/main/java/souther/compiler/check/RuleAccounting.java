/**
 * One rule where it applies to one value, every question it raises there, and what answered each.
 *
 * <p>Of a rule at a value and not of a rule. What a rule raises is written in the vocabulary of the
 * value being read and differs in number between values ({@link Required}), so a rule the model
 * holds several values to has one of these at each of them. Which value this is of is the reading
 * these come from: a reading is of one declaration, and everything holding one of these holds it
 * beside that.
 *
 * <p>Closed over the questions rather than a list of answers somebody assembled. What can go wrong
 * with a list is that a question is missing from it, and a completeness read off a list with a
 * question missing says the model was accounted for because nobody asked. So the questions come
 * from {@link Required} and the answers are obtained for exactly those, one apiece: a question
 * without an answer, an answer without a question, and two answers to one question are all
 * unreachable rather than checked for.
 *
 * <p>No verdict about the rule. Whether the rule is settled follows from its answers and from the
 * answers to whatever its questions rest on, and that is a derivation over the whole accounting
 * rather than a field here — written as a field, a question blocked by another would have to be
 * marked blocked by whoever noticed, which is a third state anybody can write.
