/**
 * What a condition states, read off the condition and nothing else.
 *
 * <p>The half of reading a guard that no path is involved in. Two questions were one here for as
 * long as one reader asked both: what a condition <em>says</em> — which comparison it is once the
 * six ways of writing one are read as one, what an emptiness check means, which relation an order
 * operation states — and what saying it makes <em>known</em> on the path it was written on. The
 * first is a function of the condition and the names around it; the second needs what the path had
 * already established. {@link Predicates} keeps the second and asks this for the first.
 *
 * <p>Which is what lets the answer be recorded. A relation a condition states is the same relation
 * wherever it is read, so it may stand beside a recipe ({@link Derivation.Chosen}) where a range
 * could not — and an arm read under what chose it is read against a domain the arm's own reader
 * holds, out of relations recorded here.
 *
 * <p>Functions and not an object. Nothing here has state or a lifetime, and {@link Terms} is passed
 * where a name has to be read rather than held: a reader this one could be given at construction is
 * a reader something has to remember to give it, and the naming of an expression is reached from
 * places that have no {@link Predicates} to hand ({@link ContractDischarge}).

    /**
     * What choosing the arm {@code decidedBy} states of the values around it, as relations.
     *
     * <p>Only what holds by that arm being the answer, and only what holds on its own. A condition
     * asserted true states each of its conjuncts; asserted false it states the disjunction of their
     * denials, which is not a list of relations, so it states none of them and this answers with
     * nothing. Under-answering costs precision and over-answering is unsound, so where the shape
     * runs out this stops — which is the opposite way round from what a recipe declares it may read
     * ({@link Derivation.Chosen.Arm}), and worth keeping straight.
     *
     * <p>A case and an attempt state nothing here. What choosing them settles is what the value's
     * type guarantees of what the arm binds, which is a declaration's answer and not a relation a
     * condition wrote, so it is read through the one reading of a declaration there is
     * ({@link TypeGuarantees}) and composed with this beside the arm ({@link Terms#chosen}).
     *
     * <p>An operation the library defines by cases states the relations its case is reached under,
     * which arrive already lowered to the values the call was given ({@link Choice}). Nothing about
     * the operation is asked here, and nothing about it needs to be.
     *
     * <p>Written as a switch over {@link Choice.Decides} with an arm for every way of deciding. As an
     * {@code instanceof} it answered "nothing is settled" for every way it had not been told about,
     * which is the same silence a new producer would want to be stopped by: a value that is one of
     * several would get its arms and lose what chose between them, and be bounded by their span with
     * no arm ruled out.
     *
     * <p><b>What the values a condition names guarantee is not here either, and the walk has it.</b>
     * {@link Predicates} takes what a size and what an operation's result are guaranteed to be into
     * what is known before it reads the condition at all: a size
     * is at or above nought whether the condition holds or not, so those are guarantees about values
     * and not statements the condition makes. An arm read here is read without them, so
     * {@code List.size(xs)} under {@code not List.isEmpty(xs)} comes to "not nought" here where the
     * walk has "above nought". Not two readings of one question — it is one question this reader
     * does not ask. It was written down as the same family as what a case and an attempt rest on,
     * and it is not: a value built through a checked constructor carries what its declaration
     * states ({@link TypeGuarantees}), and a list carries a length that is never negative because of
     * what a length is, with no declaration saying so. A third source, and #988.
