 * those needs a module's definitions or the signatures a body can reach, so a reader that only has
 * these questions is handed only this. That is the whole reason it is apart from

 * signatures, and a reader asking whether a type has an invariant was making an empty table of
 * definitions to get at it.
 *
 * <p>Which world, from the caller. An accepted program's fields are what its check settled and a
 * text that has not checked has what its declarations resolve to so far; the two are
 * {@link FieldRead}'s to hold, and a reader here is in whichever one it built.
