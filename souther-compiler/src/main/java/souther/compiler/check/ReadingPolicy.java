/**
 * What a reading may spend, in the two places it can spend without a bound.
 *
 * <p><b>How much of a declaration's clauses it may hold apart.</b> A choice between alternatives written at two positions is a union of products, and holding it
 * is what lets the next conjunction answer each position exactly. What it costs is one alternative
 * per branch, multiplied through every conjunction — so a clause written to expand far enough is
 * one no reading should try, and the reading falls back to merging the alternatives into the one
 * product containing them.
 *
 * <p><b>A guardrail and not a precision setting.</b> Measured over the compiler's own suite —
 * 68,725 readings, 42,377 clauses — the largest expansion any clause reaches is five, and 98.97% of
 * clauses reach one; over the bench corpus, which is whole applications, every clause reaches one.
 * So nothing written here is read by the fallback at any limit of eight or more. What the design
 * needs is that a finite limit exists; which one a compilation sets is the compilation's, and is
 * written where a reading cannot reach it.
 *
 * <p><b>How far from the point it will lay out a grid.</b> A divide rounded to a scale answers a
 * value of that scale's grid, and what a range says of it is the two points of that grid the exact
 * quotient lies between (spec §invariant-discharge-arithmetic). Laying one out costs a digit per
 * place, so a scale written large enough is a grid no reading should try to name — a million places
 * is a number a megabyte wide. A scale past the limit is a scale this reading has no grid for,
 * which is what a scale it cannot read as one number already is.
 *
 * <p>The two questions a scale raises are not one. What the run time takes is settled by the
 * language, which holds a scale to what can be handed over as the number it is and aborts outside
 * that (spec §stdlib-decimal); what a reading can lay out is settled here. A reading that asked
 * only the first would be one whose cost the source decides, and one that merged the two would put
 * a resource bound where a statement about the arithmetic belongs.
 *
 * <p><b>Owned by the compilation and not made here.</b> Nothing that reads a declaration decides
 * what it may be read with: a policy made where it is needed is one that can differ between two
 * readings of the same declaration, and the two would answer a position differently while each
 * stayed sound. So this arrives from the query graph, and the analysis takes it.
