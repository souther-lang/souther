/**
 * What a written declaration came to: each parameter beside the shape it was admitted as, and what
 * the behavior answers.
 *
 * <p>A {@link Sig} says what crosses the boundary and nothing about where it came from. That is the
 * whole of what a codec, a composition and an emitter need, and it is not what a reader pairing a
 * declaration with its signature needs: those held the parameter list and the signature separately
 * and put them back together by position, each deciding for itself whether the two could be trusted
 * to line up. The pairing is not a fact to be re-established, because the walk that admits a
 * parameter makes exactly one shape from exactly one parameter. So it is carried: an {@link Input}
 * is a declared parameter and the shape that parameter was admitted as, and there is no arrangement
 * of two lists left for a reader to check.
 *
 * <p>Made by {@link SignatureBoundary} alone, from a behavior that wrote parameters. A composition
 * writes none — its inputs are its first stage's, borrowed as shapes — so it has no declaration to
 * pair with anything and has a {@code Sig} and no {@code DeclaredSig}. A reader that wants the names
 * a behavior gave its inputs is asking about a declaration, and asking for one of these is how it
 * says so.
 *
 * <p>The signature is derived here rather than beside here. {@link #boundary()} is built once, in
 * the constructor, out of the inputs: holding both is not two things to keep in agreement when one
 * is worked out from the other and neither can be handed in from outside.

     * through the walk, and holding one means the shape was admitted; what an {@code Input} adds is
     * that this parameter is where that shape came from, and a public constructor would let anything
     * pair an admitted shape with a name no declaration wrote it under. The reader below would take
     * that for the declaration's own answer, which is the whole of what it is being handed.
