/**
 * Says once, for a whole module, what every written type name denotes.
 *
 * <p>Before this pass a name is a spelling: {@code 金額}, {@code billing.金額}, or an alias'd
 * {@code B.金額}, and whether the three mean one type is a question each consumer used to answer for
 * itself — which is why a capability reached the positions someone wired it to and no others
 * (issues #101, #113, #124, #132, #154). After it, every {@link Ast.Name} in the tree carries the
 * {@link TypeSymbol} it denotes, and a check that wants to know whether two names are the same type
 * compares what they denote. There is no spelling left to compare.
 *
 * <p>A name that denotes nothing is reported here and is {@link Hir.Name.Unanswered} from there on
 * — a state of the name and not a stand-in identity, so nothing below reads it as a declaration and
 * nothing below has a spelling to fall back to. Where a type reference stands on such a name, what
 * it denotes is {@link souther.compiler.types.Type#ERRONEOUS}. The pass does not stop: the rest of
 * the module is resolved
 * as if the mistake were not there, which is what lets an author be told about every unknown name at
 * once and lets an editor still say what the names around one mean. A name a pass synthesized
 * already knowing what it means (a codec {@code Deriver} builds from a field's type) is left as it
 * is.
