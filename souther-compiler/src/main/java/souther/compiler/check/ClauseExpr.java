/**
 * A clause as its connectives, read out of the tree once.
 *
 * <p>What a clause is written out of — a conjunction, a choice, a denial — is the clause's own
 * shape. It used to be read by each reading that wanted it, which was one mapping from {@link Core}
 * per reading and as many chances for them to drift; and it had to be read again by anything that
 * wanted to look at the clause before answering it, which is how a walk that decided what a reading
 * could afford came to interpret {@code &&} a second time.
 *
 * <p>So the shape is read here and nowhere else. What comes out is this, and everything downstream
 * — what the values leave, where the ends are, what has to be built and what it costs — is an
 * evaluator over it. Two evaluators over one structure are not two readings of one clause: they
 * agree about what the clause is by construction, because neither of them is the thing that decided.
 *
 * <p><b>Denials are gone by the time this exists.</b> A denial is carried to the leaves as the tree
 * is read, so a conjunction denied is the choice between its parts denied, and a leaf says which of
 * the two it states. What is left holds no {@code not}, and a reader below never has to ask whether
 * it is inside one.
 *
 * <p><b>The tree's own nodes are kept.</b> A reader that walks the clause afterwards looks up what
 * this made of the very node it is holding, so every node that mapped to a shape is written down —
 * a denial and what is under it map to the same shape and both are named. Shapes are not gathered
 * across brackets for the same reason: {@code (a && b) && c} holds a node for {@code a && b}, and a
 * reader asking about it is asking about something the author wrote.
 *
 * <p><b>A binding is a shape here, and it is not a connective.</b> What a helper call expands to is
 * a binding holding the argument and the helper's body written against it (spec
 * §invariant-discharge-representation), so a clause stating its rule through a helper is a clause
 * under a binding. {@link Scoped} is where the environment a reading carries changes and nothing
 * else: it composes no statements, and what is under it is read exactly as the same rule written out
 * would be. Left as a leaf, it was a form every reading below had no word for, and an author who
 * named a rule lost the reading an author who repeated it kept.
