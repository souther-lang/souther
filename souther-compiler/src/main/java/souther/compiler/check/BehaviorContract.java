/**
 * What a behavior declares about the relation between what it is given and what it answers, read
 * once and specialized once.
 *
 * <p>Five readers want this: the check that a clause is well formed, the emitter that turns it into
 * the method a violation is found by, the classification that says how much of it a caller can
 * assume, the editor that shows that classification, and the analysis that assumes it at a call.
 * Each of them wants the clause resolved, typed, and split into the cases the answer can be. Doing
 * that once is what this is for — a reader arriving here does not go back to {@link Hir} for what a
 * case means or for what the parameters are called.
 *
 * <p>Typed once is not one tree. The language has two readings of an expression — the one that runs,
 * with the operations it is made of inlined, and the one the analysis reads, with the operations it
 * knows the meaning of left standing ({@link Terms.Of}) — and a rule is read as either. What is done
 * once is the resolving, the typing and the specialization; which tree a reader gets is that
 * reader's own question and is answered from the same rule.
