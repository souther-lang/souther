 * {@code h(a, b)} is rewritten to {@code let $k_p1 = a in let $k_p2 = b in <body>}, with the
 * helper's parameters α-renamed to fresh {@code $}-prefixed names so they cannot capture a caller
 * local (a source identifier never starts with {@code $}). Because the body is spliced into the
 * caller, the caller's construction-permission check, {@code depends on} inference, and codegen all
 * see the helper's constructions and injected calls directly — exactly as if the code had been
 * written inline (spec §blocks). Helpers must not recurse (directly or indirectly), which keeps the
