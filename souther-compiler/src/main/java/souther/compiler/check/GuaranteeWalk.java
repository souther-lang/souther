/**
 * A reader taken over the names readable off a value, told what each of them guarantees.
 *
 * <p>Mechanism and not meaning. What a declaration says is {@link TypeGuarantees}' answer and this
 * asks for it a value at a time; what this owns is getting to the values — how deep to go, which
 * names were to be left out, and stopping where a record holds another of its own kind. Two readers
 * may walk to different depths and still be reading one model, which is the whole point of keeping
 * the two apart: a scope changes which values were visited, never what a declaration states at one.
 *
 * <p>Where a name followed is written down is {@link Location#isStep}'s answer and not a rule of
 * this walk. A newtype's {@code value} is the same value under a name, so the path a walk carries
 * is unchanged by following it, and every other name is one step further in.
 *
 * <p>Nothing here decides what a stop costs. A reader is told where the walk stopped and answers
 * that for itself, because the same stop means different things to different readers: a measurement
 * that has to account for every rule owes a line for what it did not read, and a reading that only
 * wants the relations it can state is short of nothing.
