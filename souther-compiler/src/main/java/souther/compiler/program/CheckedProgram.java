/**
 * A Souther program the compiler checked, for an output that lives outside this compiler.
 *
 * <p>What crosses is what the language compiler decided: what each module declares, what each
 * behavior takes and answers, where its implementation comes from, and — where the implementation
 * is written here — the {@link souther.compiler.core.Core} the checker typed or the
 * {@link souther.compiler.core.Composition} it settled. An output emits from those. It does not
 * recover a body from source, resolve a callee, or infer a type a second time; two compilers that
 * did would disagree about a decision that is the language's and was made once.
 *
 * <p>How this compiler works out its answers is not here. There is no {@code Db} on this object and
 * none behind it: what a query was asked, and which key held which answer, is how
 * {@code souther-compiler} computes and invalidates, not part of the contract with another
 * artifact. This is a snapshot — taken when it was made, and unchanged by anything the compilation
 * that made it goes on to do.
 *
 * <p>Nor is any decision about representing these on some machine. A JVM descriptor, a class name,
 * a local slot, a Wasm block — those belong to whichever output is emitting, and two outputs may
 * settle them differently without the program meaning anything different.
 *
 * <p>Only the modules this compile checked are here. A call in a body may name a behavior of a
 * module read off the path, and that module is not among {@link #modules()}: it was compiled
 * elsewhere, and what it is here is a name and a signature, not a body to walk.
