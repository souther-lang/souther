/**
 * The cases of a published result, in the order the declaration writes them.
 *
 * <p>What this command publishes is a declaration, not a value. The parameters are already the
 * names the declaration wrote rather than anything the checker worked out, and a result written as
 * more than one case is the same: {@code Int | DivisionByZero} is what somebody wrote, and a reader
 * looking it up is looking up what they would have to write.
 *
 * <p>Which is why the order is not {@link CanonicalNameOrder}'s. A {@link Type.Union} is a set — two
 * writings of one union are one value, so a renderer given only the type cannot tell which of them
 * it came from, and shows the order this compiler decides. Here the declaration is still in hand, so
 * there is a writing to show and nothing has to be decided. No case is the result and no case is the
 * reason there is none (ADR-0007); the order carries no such claim, and is the author's for the same
 * reason the parameter names are.
 *
 * <p><b>The declaration accounts for every member, and a member it does not is said rather than
 * worked around.</b> The members were read off these same written cases — one case each, a case
 * naming a sum standing for that sum and not for its own cases, which are descended into further
 * on and not here — so a member no written case spells is this compiler disagreeing with itself. A
 * sequence made by putting the unaccounted-for members somewhere would be a third kind of order,
 * neither the author's nor one anybody decided, and the surface would publish it as the author's.
