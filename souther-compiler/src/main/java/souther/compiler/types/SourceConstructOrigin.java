/**
 * Which construct the source wrote, said in a way that copying cannot change.
 *
 * <p>A non-recursive helper is expanded at each call, so one construct the author wrote becomes
 * several in the tree that runs. Those copies are separate occurrences — each is emitted, probed and
 * reasoned about on its own — and they are one construct: the author wrote one {@code match}, and
 * writing rows for it twice covers nothing the first set did not. This is what says they are one.
 *
 * <p><b>Named for the source and not for one of its readers.</b> A coverage obligation is derived
 * from some of these, which is what this used to be called after — and a rule read off an
 * application, an application a pass expands, and an arithmetic expression that owes nothing are all
 * one of these too. What every reader shares is the question it answers: which construct of the
 * source is this.
 *
 * <p><b>The identity of a construct the source wrote, and nothing about what is owed for it.</b>
 * Which of them a coverage obligation comes from is a later reader's answer and a narrower set than
 * this: an arithmetic binary expression has one of these and owes nothing, an application has one
 * and owes rows only where a rule is read off it, and a fork owes an arm either way. Read as "a
 * construct a row can be owed for", this value would be one nobody could hand to the constructs that
 * are not.
 *
 * <p><b>Carrying one is not being instrumented and is not being numbered.</b> What a probe copies
 * off the stack is {@link souther.compiler.coverage.SourceOutcome}'s answer, and an arithmetic
 * binary expression has an origin and no number today. A rule about the strings at a position is the
 * other way round from a fork: it owes rows because it divides the position into classes, and no run
 * through it is recorded at all. So the two questions are asked separately, and a reader that took
 * an origin for a probe site would be answering the second with the first.
 *
 * <p>Minted where such a construct is read, and carried from there on. A pass
 * that rewrites one keeps the origin it was given; a pass that turns one construct into several forks
 * derives them with {@link #lowered}, so what a comprehension's guards get is a function of the
 * comprehension rather than of when the lowering ran. Nothing else makes one — an origin minted after
 * expansion would give two copies of one fork two origins, which is the thing this exists to prevent.
 * A record's constructor is public and takes every component, so that last sentence is held against
 * the compiled classes rather than left to be read: what settles an origin is written down, with who
 * calls it.
 *
 * <p>Not a name anything outside one compilation can be matched by. {@code ordinal} is the builder's
 * own count over what {@link #owner} names, and the builder does not take the numbers in the order
 * the constructs are written: a statement guard folds the rest of its block before numbering itself,
 * and a comprehension is numbered after its parts. What identity needs is that the numbering be a
 * function of the owner's syntax and that no two constructs of one owner share an ordinal, which it
 * is and they do not — the two together are what tell one construct from every other, and two
 * definitions' first constructs are two constructs. Matching one compilation's obligations against
 * another's is a different question and not one this answers.
 *
 * <p>Counted within the owner and not over the file. A count over the file makes the number a
 * function of everything written before it there, so editing one definition renumbers the
 * constructs of every one after it — and an identity that moves for an edit nothing about it can
 * see is not one.
 *
 * @param owner   what wrote the construct: the declaration, the stated behavior, the body, or a
 *                source's rows for a behavior or its stand-in. Null exactly for {@link #unwritten}
 * @param ordinal which construct of that owner, by the builder's own count over it
 * @param lowered which fork of that construct, where a lowering makes more than one out of it. Zero
 *                is the construct's own fork, which is every fork an author writes as one
 * @param kind    what the author wrote there. Not part of what tells one construct from another —
 *                the builder takes a fresh ordinal for every construct it reads of one owner, so no
 *                two origins of that owner share one and nothing here can disagree about a construct
 *                two values name. It is the answer a report needs and the tree that runs no longer
 *                holds
