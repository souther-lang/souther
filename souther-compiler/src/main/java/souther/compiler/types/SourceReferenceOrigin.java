/**
 * Which reference the source wrote, said in a way that respelling and copying cannot change.
 *
 * <p>One question and only one: <em>which occurrence of a name did the author write?</em> Not what
 * the name reaches — two references to one declaration reach the same thing and are two references
 * ({@link ReachName}) — and not how it is spelled, because a pass may respell one: a helper written
 * bare in the module that declares it is written qualified in a body carried out of that module, and
 * it is the same reference the author wrote.
 *
 * <p><b>Why neither of those could stand in.</b> A route is what a reference means, so two
 * occurrences of one name are one route; a spelling is what a pass may replace, and
 * {@code WrittenName.authored} answers whether the spelling is the author's rather than whether the
 * reference is. A place is where to underline a complaint, which is a different contract that has
 * already parted company with identity elsewhere — a body copied into another module carries the
 * place it was written at. So identity is minted where the source is read and carried from there,
 * which is what {@link SourceConstructOrigin} already does for the constructs a source writes.
 *
 * <p><b>Not a name anything outside one compilation can be matched by.</b> {@code ordinal} is the
 * builder's own count over what {@link #owner} names. What identity needs is that the numbering be a
 * function of the owner's syntax and that no two references of one owner share one, which it is and
 * they do not — matching one compilation's references against another's is a different question and
 * not one this answers.
 *
 * <p>Counted within the owner and not over the file, for the reason a construct's number is. A count
 * over the file makes the number a function of everything written before it there, so editing one
 * definition renumbers the references of every one after it — and an identity that moves for an edit
 * nothing about it can see is not one.
 *
 * @param owner    what wrote the reference: the declaration, the stated behavior, the body, or a
 *                 source's rows for a behavior or its stand-in
 * @param ordinal  which reference of that owner it is, by the builder's own count over it
