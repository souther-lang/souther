/**
 * A case as this compile resolved it: what selects it, and which atoms selecting it covers.
 *
 * <p>Two facts of different phases, held together because one reader needs both and neither can be
 * worked out from the other. A {@link CaseSelector} is what a value is tested as and read as at run
 * time, and it says that much about itself wherever it is written — {@code Some} carries the present
 * carrier, a data-named case carries its data type — with no program around it. What it
 * <em>covers</em> is not like that: a case that is itself a sum stands for the leaves under it
 * (spec §sum-data), and which leaves those are is a fact about the declarations this compile read.
 *
 * <p>So the atoms are not a component of the selector. Putting them there would make a selector
 * whose name and carrier agree and whose atoms do not — the half-decided state
 * {@code CaseSelector}'s own constructor exists to refuse, and one it could not refuse, since
 * nothing in {@code types} can ask what a name reaches. The phase boundary is the type instead:
 * below it a case is a selector, and at this level it is a selector that has been resolved against
 * the declarations.
 *
 * <p>The value is here and the resolving is not. What a case covers is read off the declarations,
 * which this package holds none of, so the descent is {@code check.CaseSpace}'s and this holds what
 * it came to. A resolved case therefore carries no reading in it — no symbols, no way of asking
 * about a declaration — which is what lets an output that names none of this compiler hold one.
 *
 * <p>Made in one place for that reason and not because the pair cannot be written down. Two atoms
 * put beside a selector they do not belong to would be a value nothing here could tell from a
 * resolved one; what stops it is that the one caller is the descent itself, and a second maker
 * would be a second answer to what a case covers ({@code check.CaseSpace#resolve}).
 *
 * <p>What a backend emits is the selector — {@link #selector()} — and what {@code Core} carries is
 * this. The two are not the same need. A backend tests and reads a value, which the selector says
 * on its own; a reader asking which case of a subject an arm picked is asking about the leaves, and
 * below the checker there are no declarations left to work them out from. Carried as a selector
 * alone, that reader answered from the name, and one name over two leaves became a place nothing
 * else in the compiler holds.
