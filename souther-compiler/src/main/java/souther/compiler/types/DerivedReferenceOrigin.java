/**
 * A reference a pass wrote, said by what made it write one.
 *
 * <p>The language has no syntax for some of what a body means — the operation an empty collection
 * stands for, the library call a checked value is written back as — so a pass writes the name. That
 * name is a reference: two of them are two, and expanding each of them as a value writes a block of
 * its own. This is what tells them apart.
 *
 * <p><b>What it is derived from is not always what a source wrote.</b> A construct the author wrote
 * is one cause; another is a reference that already carries which occurrence it is, whoever made it
 * — an author's, one another pass derived, one a generator run composed. What a cause has to be is
 * something that can be told from every other of its kind, because that is what this is derived
 * from; being the source's is one way to be that and not the only one.
 *
 * <p><b>The cause and the producer's count over it, and neither alone.</b> One construct may make a
 * pass write several names, so the cause answers which construct is behind them and not which of
 * them this is. And a count on its own moves with whatever else the pass met first.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code ordinal} is over what this cause derived, and never over a walk.</b> The count a walk
 * keeps runs differently under a different policy — which calls a pass expands is what the policy it
 * runs under decides — so a reference numbered by one moves for an edit nothing about it can see. A
 * count over what one cause produced is a function of the syntax that cause is, which is what an
 * identity has to be. The empty collection at one pair of brackets is the first thing that pair
 * derived, whatever the body around it holds.
 *
 * @param cause    what made a pass write this reference, which is something that can be told from
 *                 every other of its kind rather than a construct of a source in particular
 * @param ordinal  which of the references that cause derived this is, by the producer's own count
