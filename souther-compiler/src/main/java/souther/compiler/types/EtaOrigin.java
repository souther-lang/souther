 * What caused a function reference to be expanded into the block that applies it.

 * <p>A name written where a value goes is the function it names, and what a body holds there is the
 * block taking as many parameters as that function takes and applying it to them. The block is a
 * pass's, and the reference that made it necessary is what tells one such expansion from another.
 *
 * <p><b>The cause and not what the expansion produced.</b> The parameters the block is written with
 * are minted by that expansion, so naming it by one of them would be naming a thing by its own
 * output — and the counter those names are spelled from is the one this exists to stop being an
 * identity. What is here is the reference, which was already there before anything was expanded.
 *
 * <p>Two arms, which is what a reference in that position can be. Both were measured over the
 * models this repository carries; a third would be a generation whose meaning is worth a look before
 * it gets an arm.
