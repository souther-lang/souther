 * source, and neither can be read off the tree that runs: {@code guard} is sugar for {@code if}
 * (ADR-0020), a list comprehension is rewritten before Core exists, and by the time coverage is
 * numbered one node stands for all three. A reader asking what to call the construct, or what one of
 * its outcomes means, is asking about the source, so the answer travels from where the source was
 * read rather than being worked out again from the shape it was lowered to.
 *
 * <p>Settled where the construct is read and carried from there. Nothing derives one later — every
 * rewrite between the AST and Core copies the origin it was given, so this arrives at a report
 * unchanged however many times a helper holding the construct was expanded.
