 * A data type's identity: which declaration this is, told apart by who declared it.
 *
 * <p>Every {@link Type.Ref} carries one, so a name that reached the checker has already been
 * resolved. What the source wrote — a bare {@code 金額}, a qualified {@code probe.b.金額}, or an
 * alias {@code B.金額} — is settled during resolution and does not survive into the type.
 *
 * <p>Two ways a declaration comes to be, and the sum is over exactly that. {@link AtModule} is one a
 * module wrote, and a module and a name is what tells two of those apart: two modules may both
 * declare {@code 金額}, and only the pair says which. {@link OfLanguage} is one no module wrote —
 * a primitive standing in a union, {@code Option}'s cases, the error cases a division answers — and
 * there is no module to name, so none is named. What stood here before was a module string either
 * way, which meant every declaration the language gives had to be filed under a module nothing
 * declares: {@code souther} for a primitive, {@code souther.runtime} for the rest. Choosing that
 * string was choosing a namespace, and the one chosen was a JVM package.
 *
 * <p>Nothing here says what any of this is called on a machine. {@code jvm.SoutherJvmAbi} is where
 * that is asked and answered, and it is the only place that may.
