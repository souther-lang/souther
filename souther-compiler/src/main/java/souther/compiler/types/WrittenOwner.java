/**
 * What a source wrote a construct inside — the thing a number handed out while reading it is
 * counted within.
 *
 * <p>A construct is told from every other by a number, and a number means nothing on its own: it
 * says which construct only under something that says which constructs were being counted. Counted
 * over a whole file, the answer is a function of everything written before it there, so a
 * declaration nobody can name renumbers every construct after it — and an identity that moves for
 * an edit nothing about it can see is not one. What is counted within is written here, so the two
 * halves of an identity travel together.
 *
 * <p>The cases are not the kinds of syntax. They are what may be edited without the numbers after
 * it moving: a type declaration, a behavior's statement of itself, a definition's body, and — for
 * the two forms that several places may write for one behavior — a source's example rows and a
 * source's stand-in for it. A behavior and the definition that implements it are written under one
 * name and are two of these, because each is read on its own; so are a behavior's rows and the
 * stand-in beside them, because a row added to one is none of the other's business.
 *
 * <p>An owner of the last two says which text as well, because more than one legitimately writes
 * them for one behavior: the module's own file and every {@code examples for} file attached to it.
 * Their ordinals restart in each, so which text is part of which construct — the same three-part
 * identity {@code RowRef} carries for a row, and for the same reason. The first three do not, a
 * module holding one declaration under one name.
 *
 * <p>The text is a {@link QuotedFrom} and not a source identity, because a parse does not always
 * have one: a module read back off the module path is a text this compile cannot show, and a buffer
 * handed in on its own is a text it cannot name. Both are read by a builder like any other and both
 * may write rows, so an owner that could only be made for a file of this compile is one the builder
 * would sometimes have no way to make. It is the same answer a position carries about which text it
 * is in, asked the one way there is to ask it.
 *
 * <p>Written as the syntax says and not as a later pass settles it. Whether a {@code let} implements
 * a behavior is answered by looking for a declaration of that name, which is a question about the
 * module and not about the definition; a parse has the name and nothing else. So what is here is an
 * address among what a source wrote, and the settled forms it lines up with —
 * {@code Names.Declaration}, {@code Bodies.Stated}, {@code Bodies.LoweredBody} — are answers to
 * their own questions that happen to agree with it.

     * asks for this where it is made, so what it holds is a body's from then on.
