/**
 * The ways an expression arrives at a value, read off the body it is written in.
 *
 * <p>One reading for three questions that were being answered separately and had to agree: whether
 * an expression can be evaluated to a value at all, what that value is where it is a truth, and
 * under what conditions each way there holds.
 *
 * <p><b>Two halves, and only one of them has a naming in it.</b> {@link Comes} says what the body
 * does and is computed with no naming at all — it is what the reading with no numbering behind it
 * answers, and every reader asking whether a value arrives or what it comes to is answered from
 * there. {@link Paths} says what the ways are called, and it is the only half a naming touches: a
 * condition it has no words for leaves a way {@link Completeness#PARTIAL}, a pair of conditions it
 * sees settle one decision opposite ways leaves a way out, and more ways than it will hold apart
 * leave {@link Paths.Beyond}. None of those can move the other half, because the other half was
 * never computed with a naming to begin with.
 *
 * <p>Which is stronger than saying it. Before, the naming reached the answer three ways — a way it
 * could not name, a pair of ways it refused, a count it would not hold — and two of them were still
 * changing whether a value arrives. A reading of the numbering was deciding what the body does,
 * which is the thing this was made to end.
 *
 * <p><b>Rooted at a body.</b> What a name reads is not a fact about the node that reads it: the same
 * {@code Core.Read} is a position of the input in one body and a {@code let} away from a number
 * written out in another. So the body is read once, every occurrence in it is settled under what the
 * binders above it bound, and a caller asks about a node it already has.
 *
 * <p><b>An arrival is a value.</b> Two that say the same thing are one way, so a way found twice by a
 * reading that got there two ways is still one way, and anything counting these is counting what the
 * body does.
