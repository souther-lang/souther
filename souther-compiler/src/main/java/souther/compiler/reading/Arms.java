/**
 * How each arm of a body is reached, one answer per arm the plan numbered.
 *
 * <p>Total over the arms of the behavior, which is what makes it worth asking. A measure that finds
 * an arm no row goes through hands the arm on to whatever composes rows, and an arm the reading had
 * nothing on used to be an arm nobody could say anything about: the absence was read as a fact about
 * the body — that nothing takes it — which is not what an absence says. Every arm the plan numbered
 * is here, and an arm this reading never got to says so in as many words.
 *
 * <p>By the number the plan gave the arm, which is the number the site carries and the number a
 * finding is written against. One identity, not two spellings that agree until one moves.
 *
 * <p>The arms and not the obligations. Two occurrences of one arm put together are one thing to
 * report and two places in the body, and what it takes to reach them is what differs — so an answer
 * held per obligation would be one occurrence's way in standing for another's.
