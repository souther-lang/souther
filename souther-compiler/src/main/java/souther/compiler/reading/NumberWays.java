/**
 * Which ways a comparison has a value behind it, answered from the number it is about.
 *
 * <p>The reading a body's comparisons are admitted by. A comparison names a number of the input, the
 * rules leave that number a run of values, and a way stands where some value of that run falls on
 * the side the way needs. Nothing here reads how the comparison was written: which side the number
 * was on, whether it was a name or something taken of one, and what kind of node stands there are
 * all settled before this is asked ({@link ComparedNumber}).
 *
 * <p><b>Why that is the question.</b> Read off the shape of the operands, a comparison over a number
 * taken of a location is a call against a literal and nothing about it says a value varies — so the
 * way was never held, the decision was never named, and no row was ever steered into the arm behind
 * it. The number is what varies, and the number is what is asked about here.
 *
 * <p>The same reading the decision is named from ({@link ComparedNumbers}). Admitting a way and
 * saying which decision it settles are two questions about one comparison, and answering them from
 * two readings is how a way came to be held for a number the naming could not find.
 *
 * <p>Where the comparison draws no line — a number over a run of values, one position against
 * another, a value no order writes — the body's own text answers as it did before. That is not a
 * second answer to this question: it is the answer for the comparisons this one has nothing to say
 * about.
