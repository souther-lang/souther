/**
 * One reading of a body's decisions: where a run can get to, and what holds on the way.
 *
 * <p>What a black-box measure has to assume about every pair of inputs, read instead. Every measure
 * over a body reads control flow — which arms were entered — and passing through all four arms of
 * {@code if A { if B { X } else { Y } } else { Z }} says nothing about whether the interactions
 * between A and B were tried. This reads what a value owes itself to, and what it takes to arrive
 * anywhere in the body.
 *
 * <p>One walk and several facts, which is why the walk is here rather than inside any of them. What
 * holds on the way to a place is one thing about the body, and the readings that want it want it for
 * different work: {@link Meetings} asks it of the places where decisions determine one value
 * together, {@link Arms} of every arm the plan numbered. A reading given its own walk would be a
 * second reading of the same body, free to disagree with this one the day either of them moves —
 * which is how a fact came to be spelled twice before. So what is shared here is where the walk goes
 * and what holds there; what is found is each collector's own, and so is the state finding it needs.
 *
 * <p>What stops is the reading and never the classification. A place no run reaches, and one this
 * reading has no words for, are both places whose arms the plan numbered and a measure will ask
 * about — so the walk goes on through them carrying what it came to, and every arm inside is told
 * which of those it is. Stopping the walk instead left those arms out of the answer, and an arm left
 * out is an arm somebody has to decide the meaning of.
 *
 * <p>Which position a decision is about is {@link InputReads}'s answer and not this one's. A name is
 * not a position — a helper spliced into a body binds the call's argument to the helper's own
 * parameter and matches that, so a reading that took the word would say about one parameter what is
 * true of another. Two environments are carried down for that reason and they answer different
 * questions: {@code InputReads} says which position a name points at, and the bindings here say
 * what the value at a name was settled by.
 *
 * <p>A path to a value and what the value is are two questions, and neither is asked here. Both are
 * {@link ValueArrivals}'s, read off the body once and asked of by whoever needs them — this walk and
 * the reading of whether an arm answers anything included. What is added here is the third question:
 * what to call a way, which is where the numbering comes in and is the only place it does. A
 * condition this can find no words for leaves a way {@link souther.compiler.flow.Completeness#PARTIAL}
 * and takes nothing away from what the body was read to do.
 *
 * <p>Under-reading is the safe direction. A group nothing formed is an obligation nobody is asked
 * for, which is where a product over the input positions already leaves things; a group formed too
 * eagerly asks for rows that establish nothing. Both limits below take that direction: a value that
 * can be settled more ways than the reading will tell apart is answered as settled one way, and a
 * position reached more ways than it will read at once is read the one way it used to be.

     * How many path contexts one position of the body will be read under.

     * <p>A second amplification and not the one beside it. {@link CoverageNaming#MOST_OUTCOMES}
     * bounds the ways one value is read as being settled, which is a product taken at one node; this
     * bounds how many ways in one position is read under, which is a product taken along the way
     * down to it. A condition that fails four
     * ways standing inside another one is a meeting read sixteen times, so the two multiply with the
     * nesting of the body and neither bound holds what the other does.
     *
     * <p>The contexts that survive and not the alternatives the syntax offers. A way in settling a
     * decision that the way in above it settled the other way is no path at all, and letting it take
     * a share here would move where the bound falls with how the body is written rather than with
     * how much there is to read.
     *
     * <p>Counted and not estimated, which is why the walk carries the contexts of a position
     * together. How many of them survive is a fact about the position and about all the ways down to
     * it at once — a walk arriving one way at a time cannot know what the ways beside it came to,
     * and multiplying what it does know stands in for the answer without being it: uneven arms make
     * that product larger than the number of contexts there are, and a position under the bound is
     * given up on as though it were over.
     *
     * <p>Held by induction rather than by a running count. A position is read under at most this
     * many contexts, and what an arm below it is read under is either those held to the ways the
     * condition comes out — checked against the bound where it is built — or, over the bound, one
     * per context, which is what there already were.
     *
     * <p>Over the bound an arm is read the one way a fork whose condition this reading cannot value
     * is read, which is where every fork was before the ways in were told apart. Going over asks
     * for no more than was asked for then, and what an arm under it is told is that the limit is
     * what stopped this rather than anything about the body.
