 * <p>Not every kind. Where a plurality comes with the order the model has — the reasons a question
 * stands are the parts of the rule that raised it, and a document promises that order — nothing
 * here has anything to decide, and an order written for such a kind would answer by a precedence
 * nothing in the model decides ({@link SourceOrdered}). What is written here is for the kinds that
 * cross saying which of them hold and nothing more.
 *
 * <p>Of those, one kind, one order. A kind said in two places — an observation's code is said of a
 * reading that stopped short and again of a value nothing could read back — has one order all the
 * same, or the two lines of one block would put the same pair of reasons in two orders and nothing
 * would say which was meant.
 *
 * <p>Written here rather than read off how the constants are declared. A declaration is arranged
 * for whoever reads the code, and moving one is a change nobody expects to see in a document; read
 * off {@code values()} or off an {@code EnumSet}, it is one, and every consumer of the report has
 * to be compared against the last run to find it.
 *
 * <p>None of these orders is a rank. What they are for is that a report comes out the same twice,
 * and what a reader does with two reasons is do both.
