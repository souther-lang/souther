/**
 * One entry of what a document says holds an adequacy verdict open, as the document writes it.
 *
 * <p>The whole of what the schema has room for: which kind of thing it is, the reason beside it
 * where the kind has one, and whether a wider run of this compiler could answer it. What the
 * verdict rests on and which measure raised it are how the entry came to be, and a reader is shown
 * none of it.
 *
 * <p><b>Which is why two of these can be equal.</b> The array's unit is the fact, so two measures
 * that went without two rules this compiler could not read are two entries; the document calls both
 * of them the same thing, and it says it twice. Folded, the array would count kinds, which is what
 * the array beside it already does.
 *
 * <p>So an order over these tells apart everything a reader can and nothing a reader cannot, and
 * two entries it cannot tell apart are two entries a document writes alike
 * ({@link CanonicalArrangement}).
