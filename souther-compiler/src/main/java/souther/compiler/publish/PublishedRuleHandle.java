/**
 * How a document sends a reader to a rule, as one of the sentences a document writes.
 *
 * <p>The projection of a {@link RuleCitation} onto what varies in that sentence: the name where the
 * author gave one, and otherwise what the rule is, whether the code is here or reached from here,
 * and where it is. Everything else a citation carries is how this compiler came to be holding it.
 *
 * <p><b>The arms are the published grammar and not the internal seal.</b> Which sentence a document
 * writes does not divide the way {@link RuleRef} divides: an invariant clause the author named and
 * one they left to be counted are two sentences under one arm of that seal, and a citation and a
 * place are two seals whose product is not the grammar either. Walked for the internal division,
 * the population of forms a contract has to describe comes out short by exactly the forms a value
 * decides — which is how a schema came to promise one shape for a field that writes several. So the
 * division here is by sentence, and a form nothing spells stops the compile.
 *
 * <p><b>Made so that two handles a document writes alike are one value.</b> Choosing one of several
 * takes a comparison, and a comparison over what a citation is rather than over what is written of
 * it can come out equal for two handles a reader can tell apart — and then which is written is
 * whichever the set of them happened to iterate first, which is the thing this whole type exists to
 * have removed.
 *
 * <p>So this and never {@link RuleCitation} is what the order is over, and what it must keep is one
 * property: two of these that are equal are two a document writes the same sentence for.
 *
 * <p><b>The spelling is this layer's and is reached through a surface.</b> What the sentence reads
 * as is {@link RuleHandleSentence}, and what may ask for it is {@link RuleHandleSurface} — so every
 * place a rule handle reaches a reader is a place that named itself, and the surfaces a document has
 * are a set a check can hold against the schema rather than a habit callers keep.
