 * What a place reads as in the report a person reads.

 * <p>One spelling, because a reader meeting two places in one report is meeting two places and not
 * two conventions. It was a private method of {@link RuleHandleSentence} while a handle was the
 * only thing with a place in it; a second caller wanting the same words would have written them
 * again, and a line and a column mean nothing until somebody says which file they are of.
 *
 * <p>Not {@link RuleHandleProse}. That says how a reader is sent to a rule, and who may ask it is
 * counted ({@code WhoMaySayWhatARuleHandleReadsAs}) because a handle reaching a document past
 * {@link RuleHandleSurface} is a field no check knows about. A place is not a handle: it says where
 * to look and never which rule, so asking for one is not a way to write a handle.
