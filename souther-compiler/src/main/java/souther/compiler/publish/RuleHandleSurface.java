/**
 * A field of the adequacy document that carries a rule handle.
 *
 * <p>An enum, so the fields a document publishes a handle into are what the compiler has rather than
 * a list somebody keeps. Each names the field by where the schema declares it, which is what tells
 * two fields of one name apart: {@code rule} is written under three parents, and a set of keys would
 * have said there were fewer fields than there are and gone on saying it as more were added.
 *
 * <p><b>Writing is the whole of what this offers.</b> There is no way to ask one of these what a
 * handle reads as, because a renderer that handed a string back is a renderer whose answer can be
 * put under a field nobody declared — and the count of fields would then be the count of the ones
 * somebody remembered to register. What a person's report shows is
 * {@link RuleHandleProse}, and which classes may name that is written down
 * ({@code WhoMaySayWhatARuleHandleReadsAs}).
 *
 * <p>A field whose sentence has words of its own takes {@link PublishedSentence} rather than the
 * finished words, so that the handle inside it is one this put together.
