/**
 * A place a document sends a reader to, as the document writes it.
 *
 * <p>The projection of a {@link Citation} onto the four things the shipped schema has room for: a
 * source identity, a line, a column, and what the code at that place is to the module the document
 * is about. Everything else a citation carries is how this compiler came to be holding it.
 *
 * <p><b>Made before anything is put in order.</b> A citation is a sum whose arms are not all places
 * — a position in a text no reader holds is not one, and neither is code out of sight with no
 * position inside it — so there is no order over citations to be had, and asking for one would be
 * asking which of two things that are not places comes first. What has an order is this: every one
 * of these is a place, and what one is written as is what tells two of them apart.
 *
 * <p>So this and never {@link Citation} is what a canonical order is over, and what a witness is
 * chosen from, and {@code PublicationOrders.PLACES} is the order.
 *
 * <p><b>It names the source and does not resolve it.</b> What a document calls a source is the
 * renderer's, recorded as the document writes it; asked here, the choosing of one place out of
 * several would decide which sources a document explains by the order it compared them in.
