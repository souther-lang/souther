 * What one entry of a document is about, as the document writes it.

 * point is a line, a level and a side; what names a position is a spelling for a person and a
 * second one that tells two of them apart. Held as one product, every arm would carry the fields of
 * every other and a consumer would be left reading which of them are filled in to find out what it
 * was handed.
 *
 * <p><b>Two answers where the two differ, and one word where they do not.</b> What a reader is
 * shown and what tells two entries apart are not always the same thing. A position spelled as an
 * author would recognise it can be the spelling of two positions this compiler holds apart, and the
 * spelling that separates them is one its own owner says is for a message about this compiler and
 * never about a model. So both are written: the surface is what a person reads and the identity is
 * what a consumer joins and what an order is taken over. It is the split the rule handles already
 * make, where {@code rule} is the reader's and {@code ruleId} is the document's.
 *
 * <p>{@link #identity()} is what the canonical order reads, and it has to tell apart every two
 * subjects the compiler holds apart. A reader-facing spelling is allowed not to.
