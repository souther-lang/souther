/**
 * What a document calls the thing a measure nobody made was waiting for.
 *
 * <p>An enum for the reason {@link AdequacyOpeningWord} is one: the shipped schema names these
 * words in its own file and is held against this, so a word added here has to be taught to the
 * schema before it can be written.
 *
 * <p>Fewer words than there are reasons. Nine measures can go unmade and each says which of these
 * three it was waiting for — a measure with no rows to read is the same news whichever measure it
 * was, and which measure it was is said where the measure is. So this is the vocabulary and not the
 * list of things that produce it, which is why a sequence of these can be put in an order at all.
