/**
 * A declaration reached through a dependency's published classes says what its author wrote, down
 * to the definitions the author never exposed.
 *
 * <p>The third of the three the spec puts on one footing: a type declared in this module, one
 * imported from a module compiled in the same run, and one imported from a module compiled
 * separately and reached through its classes all state the same invariant
 * (spec §invariant-discharge-representation). The first two are held next door; this is the one
 * where nothing of the library is in the room but its artifact.
 *
 * <p><b>The {@code let} is deliberately not exposed.</b> It is what the clause is composed out of,
 * and an importer has no name for it — so a reading that tried to work the clause out here could
 * not, however it went about it. What makes this work is not that the definition is importable but
 * that the artifact carries what the declaration cannot be read without, and the clause is expanded
 * where it was written. Exposed, the test would pass for a reason that says nothing: the consumer
 * would have a name for the value and a reading built the wrong way round would still reach it.
 *
 * <p>Held against the literal clause beside it rather than against a form of words. Both are read
 * to the end, so both come to the same measure; if the composed one is not read, its measure moves
 * and the literal one does not.
