/**
 * Every question a reading answers about a term or a position refuses one that is not of it.
 *
 * <p>Asked of the questions rather than of a list of them. Each of these answers about some place of
 * one behavior's input, and each has a way of coming back with something for a place of another: an
 * order that follows from the operation alone, a count nothing bounds, a range over rules that reach
 * nothing. A refusal is the only answer that is true of a reading that was never asked about that
 * place, and the check that says so has to be on every question rather than on the ones somebody
 * remembered — this file is written so that a question added later without it fails here.
 *
 * <p>What a question takes decides whether it is asked. A method that names a
 * {@link NumericTerm} or a {@link PositionId} is about a place and is held to the rule; one that
 * takes neither is about the reading as a whole and is listed below by name, so that a question
 * taking something new is a failure here rather than a silent exemption.
