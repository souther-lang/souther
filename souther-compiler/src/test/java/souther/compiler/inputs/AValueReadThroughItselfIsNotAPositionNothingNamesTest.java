/**
 * A name whose value is read through itself is not a name that reaches no position.
 *
 * <p>The two answers are told apart because what a reader is told about the model depends on it.
 * Arithmetic over a position stands nowhere, and a rule about it is reported as being about a value
 * made from somewhere else — a sentence about the model, and a true one. A binding that holds a
 * value read through itself is not a model at all: the lineage this compiler builds runs one way,
 * so a value read through itself is a representation it made and says it does not make.
 *
 * <p>Handed one of those, the reading raises rather than answering. What it must not do is come back
 * with the answer a plain expression gets, which would put a report of this compiler's own state
 * into a document about somebody's model — the thing this reading was made to stop doing.
 *
 * <p>No source builds one, which is why the environment is written out here: what is being held is
 * the reading's behavior over an environment it may be handed, and a walk over the models that
 * compile could never reach it.
