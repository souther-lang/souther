/**
 * How many names a closure's answer stands under does not decide where in the element it is.
 *
 * <p>The law beside the one held of input positions, and not the same law. That one is about a walk
 * to a position of the input, with the roots, the containers and the provenance of elements to
 * reach it by; this is about a way inside one value, read from a name, a {@code let} and a field
 * and nothing else. Two readings, two statements, and a number reintroduced into either is caught
 * by its own.
 *
 * <p>Held here rather than through a model, because what this reading takes is a closure's answer
 * and the names in the body it was left in — and a body binds those names for reasons of its own,
 * so a model grown until the chain is long is a model grown for something else. What the chain is
 * long by is the point.
