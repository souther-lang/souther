/**
 * A reading refuses a term under nothing the behavior it is of takes.
 *
 * <p>Every other question here refuses one, and what a term is measured on has to refuse it for the
 * same reason: an order follows from what stands where the number comes from, and there is nothing
 * standing anywhere for a path this input has no parameter for.
 *
 * <p><b>An answer would come back, which is why the refusal is the point.</b> What an operation
 * answers with follows from the operation for every operation whose answer does not depend on what
 * it was given — a length is a whole number whatever it is a length of — so a term of another
 * input's parameter comes back ordered on one end and blank on the other. That is an answer about no
 * reading at all, wearing the name of this one.
