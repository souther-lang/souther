/**
 * Where two positions of an input stand against each other is settled by the clauses relating them,
 * and by nothing that is read underneath either one.
 *
 * <p>Which reading owns the rules of a value and which readings a quantity is asked over are
 * different questions, and the second is the one this holds. A reading begun under a position — at
 * the narrowing that says an optional holds something, at the element a sequence holds — is there to
 * read what that value's own declaration states. It is not a party to a relation written above it:
 * a clause relating two fields of a record is written in that record, so the reading of the record
 * is what carries it, and a reading opened below one of the fields carries nothing of it either way.
 *
 * <p>So the answers below are the same whether or not such a reading exists. Held against sources
 * and over the quantities themselves, because the thing that could go wrong is not a wrong number
 * but a right number arrived at from a different set of readings: a relation that survived only
 * because the readings it was collected from happened to be the roots of the walk would move the day
 * the walk opens a root somewhere else.
 *
 * <p><b>What this refuses is a coincidence, not a value.</b> {@link InputDomain#quantities} takes the
 * roots of the rule reading and uses them twice — as where the clauses come from, and as the
 * positions a quantity may be asked about. Nothing says those two are one set. This is what says
 * that adding to the first does not move what the second answers.
