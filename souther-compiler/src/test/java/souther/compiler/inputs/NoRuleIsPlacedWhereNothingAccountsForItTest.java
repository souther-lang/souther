 * this compiler had nowhere to put is a rule nobody wrote — which is how a field every case of a sum
 * spreads came to be bounded by a clause no report ever mentioned.
 *
 * <p><b>What the answers are allowed to be is written out below.</b> A cause this has not met is a
 * failure here rather than a line in a report nobody looked at: the day one turns up, somebody comes
 * and decides what a reader should be told about it. So a shorter list is a failure as much as a
