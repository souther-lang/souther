/**
 * The two halves of what a choice between alternatives means.
 *
 * <p>A sum has a value wherever any of its cases does, so what proves it has none is every case at
 * once — and a case this reading never entered is not one of those. Nothing was shown about it,
 * which is not the same as its having been shown to hold nothing, and a proof built from it would
 * say a model has no value because this compiler stopped looking.
 *
 * <p>Beside {@link AViableCaseSurvivesADeadSiblingTest}, which measures that one refused case takes
 * nothing with it. What this measures is that the reading can still prove the thing it is supposed
 * to prove, and that it stops proving it exactly where it stops knowing.
