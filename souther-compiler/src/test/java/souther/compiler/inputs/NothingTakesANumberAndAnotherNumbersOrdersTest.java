/**
 * A number and a pair of orders do not travel as two things anybody can choose.
 *
 * <p>{@link TermOrders} says which number it is of, so a reader that has one needs nothing else to
 * know what it is an answer about. What it does not stop by itself is a caller writing the number
 * down beside it: two arguments are two things to get right, and {@code f(termA, ordersOfB)}
 * compiles wherever the two are taken apart — which is the defect this reading exists to stop, said
 * one call along.
 *
 * <p>So the rule is about every place that takes both, whether it is a constructor, a factory or a
 * reader: either it does not take both, or it proves they agree. Proving is
 * {@link TermOrders#areOf}, and a method that takes both without calling it is what this reports.
 *
 * <p><b>Enumerated by the machine and not by a reader.</b> The three rounds of review this rule went
 * through each found another spelling of it — a record here, a signature there, a package-private
 * entry that came in with a refactor — because the population was read off the sources by whoever
 * was looking. What a class file carries is every method that takes the two, whatever it is called
 * and wherever it was written.
