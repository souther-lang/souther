/**
 * Fixing a position refines what is asked, and what is asked is the whole of what was fixed.
 *
 * <p>Three searches condition this input's rules, each fixing positions in an order of its own. What
 * the rules leave may not depend on that order, or two of them asking the same thing get two answers
 * and neither is wrong about anything a reader could check. So the answers are held to an algebra:
 * fixing nothing changes nothing, fixing twice is fixing both, and the two orders agree.
 *
 * <p>Held of what is proved empty as well as of what is left. A proof reached by one route and not
 * by another would make which question was asked first into something a caller can see, and the
 * routes are a cache and an arithmetic — neither of which the model has anything to do with.
 *
 * <p>Not a check that the reading is made a particular way. Conditioning that kept every relation
 * would satisfy this however it was carried, and that is the point: what is fixed here is the
 * meaning, so an implementation may change under it.
