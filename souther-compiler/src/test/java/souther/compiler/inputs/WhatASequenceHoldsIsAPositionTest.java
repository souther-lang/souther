/**
 * What a list holds is a position of the input, read the way every other position is.
 *
 * <p>A coordinate and nothing else is added. Which element it names is not a question a path
 * answers, and the reading here asks the element's own declarations exactly what it asks a bare
 * parameter's — so a bound written on the element's type is a bound at this position, with no
 * combinator, no closure and no body involved in reaching it.
 *
 * <p>Beside the list and not instead of it. A record is given up in favour of its fields because it
 * states nothing of its own; a list carries a length that rules are written about, so it stays a
 * position and what it holds is another one.
