/**
 * A position under a case belongs to two values, and every answer about it says which of them it
 * asked.
 *
 * <p>A field every case of a sum spreads is a position of the case and a name the value the sum sits
 * in writes about. So each answer a reading takes from {@link PlacedRules} has a decision to make —
 * whether the value above is asked, and what the two come to together — and each of them made it
 * where it was written, by looking at the answer beside it.
 *
 * <p><b>Which is why the set is written down.</b> One of these was missed exactly because it did not
 * look like the others: {@code projection} was the whole-value question and took no position, so
 * mirroring its neighbours did not reach it, and a field the value above bounded came back proved
 * exactly representable by a reading that had never seen those rules. A register catches that and a
 * symmetry does not: an answer added here without a line below fails, and a line here with no answer
 * fails too.
 *
 * <p>What it does not check is that each answer does what its line says. That is what the fixtures
 * beside it are for, and where one is missing the line says so.
