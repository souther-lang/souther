/**
 * Where a run reads its values from, and what may be assumed of every value it walks.
 *
 * <p>A number taken over a run is answered by no single position, so where its values run is not a
 * position's answer either. What is left is to say it of the path the run reads from — and a path
 * that descends through a sum stands at no position at all. One stands under each case, and the
 * cases disagree.
 *
 * <p>So the reach an occurrence may be assumed to lie in is the join over the cases the path stands
 * under, and it is that whichever case a particular occurrence turned out to be: a run walks every
 * occurrence and no case is fixed for the walk. Taken from one of them — the first the reading
 * found, or the one a context happened to have opened — a total would be held against numbers half
 * the rows it is measured over never reach.
 *
 * <p>And a reader holding some of the cases can say nothing, which is what {@code CasesRead} already
 * says of a sum: a sum has a value wherever any case does. So the join is an answer only where every
 * case was read, and the absence of one case is the absence of the answer rather than a narrower one.
