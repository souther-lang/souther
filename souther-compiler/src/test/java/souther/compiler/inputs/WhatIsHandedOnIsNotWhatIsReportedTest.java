 * other.
 *
 * <p>A conjunct is handed on because nothing about it was settled here; it is reported because this
 * reading owed a line and drew none. Both come of the same conjunct having no end, and they are
 * different sentences to different readers — one goes to whoever reads the clause next, and the
 * other goes to an author.
 *
 * <p>The two axes move apart on a rule that names a value. An equality and a disequality place no
 * end, and that is no failure of anything: there is nothing for an author to lift and there is a
 * conjunct for the next reading to make what it can of. Built one from the other, such a rule
 * either went out as a boundary nobody wrote or could not be passed along at all.
