/**
 * Which orders a term stands on is worked out in one place, from what one reading resolved.
 *
 * <p>A term is a value that travels and a type is in every reader's hand, so anything that can put
 * the two together can answer what a number is measured on — about wherever that type came from,
 * and about no reading in particular. The answer is right only while the type the caller holds and
 * the type the reading resolved agree, and nothing says when they stop agreeing.
 *
 * <p>Which is why the derivation is package-private here and the way to it is
 * {@link Quantities#ordersOf}. Visibility settles who may call it; it does not settle how many
 * places inside this package do, and a second one is the same defect written where the compiler
 * cannot see it. So this counts them.
 *
 * <p><b>Counted in the sources rather than declared in a list.</b> A list of allowed callers is a
 * thing to keep up to date, and the first person to add one keeps it up to date by adding
 * themselves. The count is what the rule says.
