/**
 * A name an operation handed an element on is answered by the container it came from, and by
 * nothing beside it.
 *
 * <p>A binding can be both. Two walks over one collection joined into one leave the second walk's
 * element bound to what the first walk's closure made of an element of the first — so the binding is
 * what an operation handed an element on, and it holds a value, and the value reaches the position
 * that closure read. Answered by whichever road reaches a position, the reading says the name
 * <em>is</em> what it was <em>made from</em>, and a rule about it draws a line at values it is not
 * about. An author cannot tell such a line from one their model states.
 *
 * <p>So the two are not roads to race. What the name is decides which step is taken, and where a
 * name is an element the container answers however that comes out — including when it comes out
 * saying nothing.
 *
 * <p>Written out rather than compiled, because the environment is what is being held to. The shape
 * is one a rewrite leaves and not one a body says, and a model that produces it today would be
 * evidence about that rewrite rather than about this rule.
