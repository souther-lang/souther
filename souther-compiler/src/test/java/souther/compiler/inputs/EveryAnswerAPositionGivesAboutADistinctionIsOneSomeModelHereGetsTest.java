/**
 * Every answer a position can give about a distinction is one some model here is answered with.
 *
 * <p>Which arm a position comes back with is what a consumer acts on: a refusal is a case nobody
 * may write a row at, an admission is one a caller can supply, and an unsettled answer is neither.
 * A change that moves a model from one of them to another is a change to what the compiler says,
 * and it is invisible to a suite that never asks for the arm it moved to.
 *
 * <p><b>Counted from the type and not from a list.</b> The arms are read off {@link Admits}'s own
 * permitted subclasses, so an arm added later is one this fails on until some model here is
 * answered with it. Written out instead, this would be a copy of the declaration that stops being
 * one the day the declaration grows.
 *
 * <p>One model answers all three, which is the point of it: the rules of {@code R} refuse
 * {@code k = B} and leave {@code k = A}, and a reading that cannot hold what the two clauses leave
 * settles neither.
