/**
 * A narrowing is spelled where narrowings are owned, and nowhere else.
 *
 * <p>Two vocabularies say which narrowing a place carries. What a position's type divides into is
 * {@link Case}, read by {@link Distinctions}; which of those divisions a written arm selected is
 * {@link ResolvedCase}, decided by the checker. Both settle a narrowing on their own, so both have
 * a way in here — and what may not have one is a value that settles less than a narrowing.
 *
 * <p>A name is such a value, and it falls short twice over. An optional's present carrier and a
 * case of a sum declared as {@code Some} are written the same word. And a case that is itself a sum
 * is one name over several leaves (spec §sum-data) while a position divides into the leaves, so
 * {@code OnceKind} names no one of them. Both were live: {@code Refinement.sumCase(TypeSymbol)} was
 * a second way in, and the reading of a {@code match} arm used it, so a body inside {@code | Some v}
 * wrote at {@code x@Some} carrying a sum's case where the reading carried a presence, and a body
 * inside {@code | OnceKind as x} wrote at {@code k@OnceKind}, which the reading has no position for
 * at all (#1252).
 *
 * <p>Nothing compared them: a reader that looks such a path up finds nothing and says nothing.
 *
 * <p>What holds the rule is that the variants have no constructor a caller can reach and that the
 * two ways in take the two values that determine a narrowing. What holds the correspondence is
 * {@link #everySelectionTheCheckerMakesAnswersOneNarrowingOrNone}, below: exhaustiveness stops a
 * variant being added without an answer, and only a comparison stops an existing one being answered
 * wrongly.
