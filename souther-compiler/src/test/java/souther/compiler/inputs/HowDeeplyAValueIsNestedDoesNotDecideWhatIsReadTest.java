/**
 * Every path that opens no declaration twice is followed to its end, however many steps that is.
 *
 * <p>The reading used to stop after counting two steps, so whether a rule an author wrote was
 * measured turned on how deeply they had nested the value it was about. A rule at the bottom of an
 * expense claim — an amount, in a category, in a line, in a list — drew no line, and the sister
 * model whose amount sat one step higher had the same rule measured.
 *
 * <p>What ends a path is a fact about the declarations and not a number: the path returns to a
 * declaration already open on it ({@link ExpansionTrace}). So nesting decides nothing here, and the
 * tests below are about the two ways a count would have been wrong — a long path, and one type
 * standing at more than one place.
