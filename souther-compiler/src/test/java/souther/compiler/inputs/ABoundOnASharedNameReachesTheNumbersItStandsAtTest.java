/**
 * An end a record puts on a name its cases share is an end on the numbers that name stands at.
 *
 * <p>{@code Holder} says {@code q.limit <= 10} and {@code q} is a sum whose cases spread the
 * declaration that writes {@code limit}. The name is written at {@code q}; the numbers are at
 * {@code q@A.limit} and {@code q@B.limit}. A reader asking where one of those runs is asking about
 * a number the rule put an end on, and the end has to be part of the answer.
 *
 * <p><b>An end and not a relation.</b> What reaches those numbers is what the rule leaves this one
 * name, which is a projection of it. A rule over two shared names — {@code q.lo <= q.hi} — is not a
 * projection of either, and nothing of it reaches them: fixing {@code q@A.hi} leaves {@code q@A.lo}
 * running as widely as its own type does. That is the thing this test does not measure, and it is
 * not the same reading being incomplete — the relation is lost where the outer value's rules are
 * carried to the cases as per-name answers rather than as rules.
