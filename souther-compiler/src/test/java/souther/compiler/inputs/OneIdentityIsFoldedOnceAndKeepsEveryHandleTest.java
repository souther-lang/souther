/**
 * The readers that find a rule with no line put their findings in one place, which keeps every
 * handle and holds the two halves apart.
 *
 * <p>One fold for six readers. A rule found by two of them is one thing with both of their handles
 * beside it, and what makes two findings one is the rule, the place and the limit — so a fold each
 * reader wrote for itself would keep whichever handle it met first, and a fold further down could
 * only accumulate what those let through.
 *
 * <p>Two handles of one rule are two ways in and never a name and a way in. Which of the two ways a
 * rule is found is the rule's own answer, so a rule the author named has one handle however many
 * readers offered it, and one written rather than named has a handle per way a reading came in
 * through — a helper's comparison read from two calls.
 *
 * <p>And two lists there, folded apart. What a report says about a rule that came to no line and
 * what holds a measure open until somebody reads further are different things about one rule, so
 * neither is an account of the other and each is folded on its own.
 *
 * <p>Asked of the fold and not of a report, so that it says something about a rule found twice
 * whether or not this compiler's readers do that today.
