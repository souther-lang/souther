/**
 * That a position is one a partition can be derived from is carried by the input rather than
 * rechecked, so nothing downstream has to ask and nothing downstream can answer wrongly.
 *
 * <p>The set is the partition's own. It is not the set a signature admits, nor the set a field
 * admits — those two disagree with each other — so a shape is written out here and a boundary that
 * starts admitting a new one stops this compiling.
 *
 * <p>That the walk goes through it is the signature of {@link LocalInspection#inspect} and not
 * anything here: the phase takes the proof, so a position can be read only after being admitted.
 * These rows are what admitting one comes to. Asked for the proof after the local phase had
 * answered, the one shape that produces classes without being admissible — a union nobody named —
 * would have gone round it, which is the disagreement the whole type is for.
