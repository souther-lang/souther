/**
 * A branch of the walk ends where opening what is under a position would open a declaration the
 * path has already opened.
 *
 * <p>What makes the reading finite, and the only thing that does. A type that names itself is an
 * ordinary thing to declare and an ordinary thing to hold a value of: a tree holds a list of
 * itself, a chain holds an option of itself, an expression holds two of itself, and all three
 * compile, are constructible, and have an input path for every depth. Nothing else stops them —
 * a declaration that names itself with no container in between is refused for being unconstructible,
 * which is a different answer to a different question.
 *
 * <p>The occurrence is read. What the position divides into, what its rules bound, what a report
 * names it as are all answered where the path returns; what is refused is unfolding the declaration
 * a second time. A rule that names a position past it names one path rather than asking for a
 * listing, and is measured there — which is
 * {@link souther.compiler.partition.LinesWhereTheyFall}'s and not this walk's.
