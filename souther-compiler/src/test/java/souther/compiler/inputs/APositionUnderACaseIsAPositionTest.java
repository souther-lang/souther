/**
 * What a case of a sum declares is declared, so it is read.
 *
 * <p>Issue #1012. A behavior taking a sum was measured on the one axis the sum itself states: the
 * reading stopped there, and every field of every case was out of reach of the partition, of the
 * boundary and of generation. What a case holds is not chosen by whatever constructs one — a
 * {@code GlobalQuery} has a {@code tag} whether or not anything builds one — so those fields are
 * positions of the input, standing under the narrowing that says which case the value turned out to
 * be.
