/**
 * A fact a caller holds beside the rules is solved with them, not met onto their answer.
 *
 * <p>Projecting is not distributive over meeting. What the rules leave a form, met afterwards
 * against what each of its positions is known to be, is wider than what the rules and those facts
 * leave it together — and the difference is a rule going missing rather than a bound being loose.
 *
 * <p>A rule holding two positions at one apiece says nothing about a form that also names a third
 * the rules leave unbounded: the third can be taken as far below nothing as anybody likes, so the
 * form has no floor. Met afterwards against a floor the caller did have for that third position,
 * the sum of the three still has no floor, because meeting a bound on the whole form against a
 * bound on the whole form is all that is left to do. Put in first, the rule and the floor hold each
 * other up and the form stops where it should.
 *
 * <p>Asked of the input and not of one value's reading. The rules of every parameter are said
 * together here and what a caller took in is said onto them, so this is where a fact held beside the
 * rules meets them — and where it would be met onto an answer if anybody assembled one.
