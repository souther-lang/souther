/**
 * A {@code fake}'s table dispatches: the first explicit row stating the arguments it is asked, and
 * otherwise the {@code _} row. A row the dispatch can never return is a statement its author is
 * making and nothing reads, and the table said nothing about it.
 *
 * <p>Two shapes of it, pointing opposite ways. Of two explicit rows stating one input the first
 * answers, so the second is dead; of two {@code _} rows the last is what a table falls through to,
 * so the earlier ones are. Which of a pair is dead is the dispatch's to say, which is why the report
 * quotes the row that answers rather than leaving it to be read off the order — and why what decides
 * it here is the dispatch itself rather than a second reading of "these arguments are those".
 *
 * <p>An explicit row and a {@code _} row do not shadow each other in either order, which is the
 * measurement that tells a check that asks the dispatch from one that asks whether anything answered
 * before: a {@code _} written above an explicit row answers where that row is absent, not where it
 * is.
