/**
 * A module in one of these states got there by having the thing the state says happen to it.
 *
 * <p>{@link Expandable} and {@link InvariantSettled} are two claims about a module, and they used to
 * be one type with the tree: whichever question you asked, what came back said only that resolution
 * had been over it. A reader that wanted an expandable module and one that wanted a settled one were
 * handed the same value, and what told them apart was which query they happened to ask.
 *
 * <p>So the propositions here are about the ways in. Each state is reached by a step that performs
 * what the state claims — the cycle check, the settling — and there is no other way to reach it.
 * What that forbids is the shape this replaces: a carrier with an operation that takes a payload and
 * hands the claim back, which is a way to assert anything about anything.
 *
 * <p>That a tree is what the first of them is handed is not a hole. {@code check} answers about the
 * tree it is given, so a rewritten module is checked again rather than inheriting an answer given
 * about the tree it was rewritten from. A state saying "resolution produced this" would be a
 * record of where a value came from, and {@link Hir} already says the one thing such a state could
 * claim: no occurrence of it is one nothing has read.
 *
 * <p>The second half is about what a state hands out. Closing the ways in leaves the other end open:
 * a rung can hold every claim below it and still answer a route with a node, and then the claim is
 * gone with nothing saying so. That is what happened between {@code Derived} and {@code Prepared}
 * (#714) — the answers were per declaration and per definition, the assemblies poured them into a
 * tree, and above that there was nothing but nodes to hand over.
 *
 * <p>So the states hold their parts and project a tree, rather than holding a tree and being asked
 * for parts of it. Three propositions keep it that way, and each reads the production types rather
 * than a description of them kept here: the claim about a part is still made one rung up, the way
 * that proves a claim again refuses a value it is not true of, and no reader in the compiler takes
 * the projection where it wanted a part.
