/**
 * Which number a leaf states a line on does not turn on how the leaf is spelled.
 *
 * <p>What a leaf states is one question with one answer: which numbers the comparison is over is
 * what its canonical form says, and whether one of this value's positions is held to another is
 * what the two whole sides say. Both are what the attribution of an end to a conjunct already runs
 * on. A second reading of the same question is a second answer, and the narrower of the two then
 * decides wherever it happens to be asked.
 *
 * <p><b>So this is a contract between readers rather than a list of shapes.</b> Each spelling below
 * is one rule about how long a string is, written under a choice beside another rule about the same
 * length. Whatever the choice comes to, it is about that length — and a spelling that came back
 * about nothing would be one a second reader classified for itself.
 *
 * <p>Which is what {@code String.length(s) * 2 >= 4} was: the arithmetic reaches the length and a
 * walk over the two sides does not, so under a choice the rule was one this compiler said nothing
 * about and the border came back as a model that draws no line.
 *
 * <p>Not that the answers agree, because they do not and should not. One spelling is a bound this
 * compiler places and another is one it does not, so a choice offering the first draws a line and
 * one offering the second leaves an end nobody worked out. What may not differ is what the answer
 * is about.
