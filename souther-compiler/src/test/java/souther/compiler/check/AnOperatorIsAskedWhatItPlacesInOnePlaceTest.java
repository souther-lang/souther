/**
 * Who reads an operator for what it places, and how often.
 *
 * <p>A reader below the point where a binary was recognised as a comparison holds
 * {@link ComparisonClaim}, which has no case for an operator that places nothing. That stands only
 * while nothing down there goes back to the operator: one call to {@link ComparisonPlacement#of}
 * hands back the wide answer, and whoever made it has a case to invent an answer for again — which
 * is how six readings came to answer for a comparison that was never one.
 *
 * <p><b>How often, and not only where.</b> A method is licensed here for the question it asks, and
 * a second call inside it is a second question wearing the first one's licence — a reading that
 * reaches the wide answer twice has somewhere in it that could disagree with itself. So the count
 * is part of what is declared, and a call added anywhere lands as a number that does not match.
 *
 * <p>What a count cannot say is who came through a door: a licence given to a method covers every
 * caller of it. So the doors are held apart by the language instead.
 * {@link souther.compiler.inputs.ComparedNumber#of} is the wide one and is package-private, which
 * makes {@code ComparedNumbers} the one way to it from outside and a body's binaries the one thing
 * that arrives; a reader holding a comparison takes {@code lineOf} and hands over the claim it
 * already has.
 *
 * <p>Read off the compiled classes, because what a method calls is what the class file says. A
 * reading of the sources would answer the same question a second way, and would not see a call
 * written inside a lambda as the method that holds it.
