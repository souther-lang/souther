/**
 * The form a declaration is written in below the settling does not depend on whether a
 * representation could be derived for it.
 *
 * <p>Two things happen to a declaration at the derived stage, and they are told apart here: the
 * newtype constructions in what it says about itself are written as the constructions they denote,
 * and a product's decoder and encoder are read off its shape. The second can fail — a field whose
 * type nobody could name has no representation — and the first cannot fail for that reason.
 *
 * <p>What rests on it is the surface a best-effort reading of a module is given. A module holding
 * one declaration that could not be derived is still read for what its other definitions say, and
 * the declaration that could not be derived is on that surface in the form every reader below the
 * settling expects. Were the two written apart, the surface would carry an earlier spelling of one
 * declaration beside the settled spelling of the rest, and nothing in the tree would say which was
 * which.
