/**
 * What a choice's alternatives leave the positions, over every place distribution put the choice.
 *
 * <p>The same written choice stands wherever a conjunction beside it was distributed in, and the
 * copies do not agree: a conjunct met with one copy can hold a position down where the copy beside
 * it leaves all of it. So what the copies come to is a quantifier — and the two facts here are held
 * to different ones, because their readers spend opposite sides of a set.
 *
 * <p>What a branch holds down is spent as an absence, so it has to hold of every copy and the
 * copies are joined. What the choice stops is spent as a presence, so it has to have been shown by
 * every copy and the copies are met. And a copy that was no choice is the identity of both: nothing
 * there was looked at, which is not the same as a copy that was looked at and found nothing.
 *
 * <p><b>Which no model distinguishes today, and that is why the rules are pinned here.</b> The
 * state is reached: compiling this repository's own corpus meets copies that differ over what the
 * choice stops. What no model reaches yet is a reader whose published answer turns on it, so
 * keeping either copy alone passes every other test there is — and neither direction is a
 * preference, since each is the one its own reader cannot be wrong in.
