/**
 * A call under a library qualifier that reached call elaboration applying nothing is one of two
 * things, and which of them is not read off the spelling.
 *
 * <p>The library declares a member of that name, or it does not. Where it does, the call was to be
 * expanded or bound before anything typed it and neither happened — which is this compiler
 * disagreeing with itself, and nothing an author wrote or can undo. Where it does not, the author
 * named an operation the library has no member for, and that is theirs. Told apart here rather than
 * both being said as the second: a member the library keeps to itself is one a caller may not write,
 * and the report for a name nobody wrote sends the reader to look for a mistake in their own text.
 *
 * <p>A {@code private} declaration is a member for this question. Whether a caller may write the
 * name and whether the library has one are two questions, and this is the second — which is why a
 * failure to expand {@code List.foldFrom} is answered here as the compiler's rather than as a
 * misspelling of something in the published surface.
 *
 * <p>A sugar declares nothing. It is a rewrite onto a name that does, so a call still spelled as the
 * sugar is one the rewrite did not take — {@code List.fold} written with two arguments is not the
 * three-argument call it stands for — and what is wrong with it is what was written.
 *
 * <p>That such a call is refused at all is {@link
 * AnUnexpandedCallIsOnlyTypedWhereARepresentationKeepsItTest}'s; which refusal it is, is this.
