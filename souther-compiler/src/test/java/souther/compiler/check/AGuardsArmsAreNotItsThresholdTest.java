/**
 * Which values reach one arm of a guard, which is not which side of the line its value belongs to.
 *
 * <p>A threshold answers the second, and that is what decides where one class ends and the next
 * begins. It cannot answer the first: {@code x <= 5} and {@code x > 5} both put 5 on the low side,
 * and their {@code then} arms are opposite halves of the line. A measure that recovered the arms
 * from a threshold would have counted the wrong one.
 *
 * <p>Measured by putting each operator under a guard that has already settled the position, so that
 * exactly one of its two arms is one nothing reaches — and it is the other one each time. A reading
 * that took the arms off the threshold would prove the same arm for both.
