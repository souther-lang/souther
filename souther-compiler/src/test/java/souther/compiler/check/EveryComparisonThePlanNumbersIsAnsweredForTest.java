/**
 * A walk that finished answered for every comparison the plan numbered, arrivals included.
 *
 * <p>Absence and the answer that restricts nothing read alike below — a line is dropped only by a
 * proof, so a reader handed neither keeps its line either way — and that is the fail-open direction
 * and the right one. It is also why nothing downstream can notice a walk that quietly stopped
 * filing: the measure it produces is a measure over lines nobody took away, which is what a correct
 * run looks like. So the completeness of the reading is established here, where the walk finishes,
 * and not left to a consumer that has no way to ask.
 *
 * <p>Two layers and they are not one question. Whether an entry is there is a fact about this
 * analysis, which is what this test reads; what the entry means is a restriction a reader may
 * apply, and a missing one degrades to the restriction that is none.
