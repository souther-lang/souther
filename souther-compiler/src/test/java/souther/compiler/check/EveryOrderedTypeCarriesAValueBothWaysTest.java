/**
 * Which types carry a value, asked once and answered for both directions at once.
 *
 * <p>Reading a rule and writing a value at what it bounds were two types for a while, because a
 * {@code Time} and an {@code Instant} could be read and could not be written: each had an
 * order-preserving count and neither had the way back. The way back is one conversion each, and
 * leaving them out cost a rule written over either type its line (issue #846). With them written
 * every ordered type answers both questions, so there is one table again and this is it.
 *
 * <p>The round trip is the property that makes the pair a carrier rather than two functions: a
 * count written as a value and read back is the count it started as. A conversion nobody checks
 * that way is what {@link Times} declined to write while nothing called it.
