/**
 * Where a part of a clause stands is counted over the tree a reading was built over, which is not
 * the tree its author wrote.
 *
 * <p>A clause is read at each place a walk opens a value, with the fields of that construction put
 * in for the reads — and what a construction gives a field is an expression of its own. Give a
 * field a conjunction and the tree the reading is over has a connective the author of the clause
 * did not write, {@link ClauseExpr} numbers it like any other, and everything written after it
 * takes the next number along.
 *
 * <p>So an occurrence names a part among the parts of one reading. It is not what a declaration
 * could publish about a clause: two constructions of one declaration are two trees, and the part
 * an author wrote in one place is at two numbers. What does not move is what the author wrote
 * there — the construct their text counted and the copy of it a reading met
 * ({@link souther.compiler.types.ConstructOccurrence}).
 *
 * <p>The control is the other half and is what makes this a measurement of the coordinate rather
 * than of trees being different: a connective substituted after the part leaves its number alone,
 * because the walk has already passed it.
