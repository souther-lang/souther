/**
 * Each question about a shape is asked of the one that answers it, and of nothing else.
 *
 * <p>Four are asked: what is readable off a value standing at a position, what a value there is
 * composed out of, which positions a reading has under it, and what a written value has under a
 * step. They come to the same fields at a record and part at a sum whose cases share a spread, and
 * that agreement is a law over the answers — checked as one in
 * {@code WhatIsReadableAndWhatIsBuiltAgreeAtARecordAndPartAtASumTest}, which holds however the four
 * are worked out.
 *
 * <p>Four and not five. How an observed value is read down a path consumes a value and answers with
 * as many standings as it finds, so it is not one of these and no equality holds between it and
 * them; what it owes is that it admits a field by what is readable and never by what the value in
 * hand turns out to carry, which is checked where that walk is.
 *
 * <p>Which is why that law is not enough on its own. A question answered out of another's answer
 * satisfies it exactly while the two agree at a record: the reading of a value or the walk into a
 * written one could take the plan's answer again and nothing about the results would say so. So each
 * of the four has an owner and says who asks it — an exact set apiece, which is a rule about the
 * others as much as about itself.
 *
 * <p>The pair that part at a sum is the pair to watch. What is readable off a value there is what
 * its cases share, and the positions under it are under each of the cases; a reader that wanted the
 * first and took the second, or the other way about, is a reader for whom a name a clause writes and
 * a place a row writes a value at are one word.
 *
 * <p>Read off what javac made of the module rather than off the source. A call is in the constant
 * pool however it was written — under an import, through a variable of any name, from inside a
 * lambda — where a text scan reads the spellings that are there today and answers about every
 * variable that happens to be named alike.
 *
 * <p>An entry added to one of these lists is a finding and not a formality: it says a reader of that
 * question arrived, and whether it wanted the question or wanted one of its own is the thing to
 * answer before the list is edited.
