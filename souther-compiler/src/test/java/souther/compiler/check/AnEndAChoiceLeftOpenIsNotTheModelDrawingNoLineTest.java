 * <p>The two come back with no line and they are not the same sentence. Where the alternatives were
 * read, what they leave together is what the choice leaves, and a position they hold nowhere is one
 * the model draws no line at — an answer, and one a reader is owed nothing further about. Where one
 * of them is a form this compiler does not enter, a value satisfying it owes the branch beside it
 * nothing: the end is as far out as that branch allows, which is unknown. Said as the first, a limit
 * of this compiler went out as a fact about somebody's model, and an author was told to stop looking
 * for a line their own clause may well draw.
 *
 * <p><b>Composed by the reading and never worked out again from the shape.</b> Which positions a
 * choice is as wide as it is at because of an alternative is settled where the branches are
 * ({@link Settlement.WidthDependency}) and arrives here decided; what this adds is which of them the
 * reading of ends did not work out. A fold over the written clause would have to decide both again,
 * and the second is not a question a shape can answer — a branch nobody can be in constrains
