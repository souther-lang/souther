/**
 * Opening a value says which case it is. It does not produce a second value.
 *
 * <p>An arm naming one case of a declared sum, or several of them, binds what it was given — the
 * case's class is tested and the value read is that instance — so the arm's name and the scrutinee
 * are one value. Entered as a place of its own, that value had two subjects: everything the answer
 * guaranteed was filed under one and everything the arm knew under the other, with nothing relating
 * them. They agreed only because no program could reach a fact under one and read it under the other
 * (#824).
 *
 * <p>An optional's present carrier is the other case: what it binds stands under the optional and is
 * not the optional, so it is a value of its own and is introduced as one. The two are told apart by
 * what the pattern binds and not by what the arm looks like.
