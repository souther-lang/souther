/**
 * Who carries the number of a part beside the rule it is a part of, rather than the name that was
 * issued for it.
 *
 * <p>Which part of which rule a line came out of is one value ({@link PartId}), made where a clause
 * is split and carried from there. Held as a rule and a number side by side, the number has to come
 * from somewhere, and where it came from was whichever walk the holder happened to have — which is
 * how one authored part came to be numbered by two counters over two trees.
 *
 * <p>So a type downstream of that split holds the name and not the number, and this is the list of
 * what still holds one. There is one entry, and it is the pair itself: the place a clause's parts
 * are numbered, which is the place every reader below holds a name instead of.
 *
 * <p>The other number a clause has is not here and is not this question. What one part states is
 * read off the tree that part expanded into, and which of those statements a line came out of is
 * counted within the part — a different decomposition, with a mint and a check of its own
 * ({@link souther.compiler.partition.ClauseStatementId}). Held on one list, the two would be one
 * allowance covering two things, and either could grow a second counter under the other's reason.
 *
 * <p>Read off the compiled classes, because what a type carries is what the class file says.
