/**
 * A name is an alias for what it was given, so a fact about the name is a fact about that value.
 *
 * <p>What each binding is about is recorded where the binding is entered ({@link Denotations.Means}),
 * and what an expression is about is worked out from the expression ({@link Terms#subjectOf}). Both
 * answer for a name, so they have to answer alike — a name recorded as being about one value and read
 * as being about another is one value with two subjects, which is the thing a subject exists to stop.
 *
 * <p>Asked at each kind of thing a name can be given, because the recording and the reading take
 * different routes through {@link Denotes} and only agree if the four line up: a place, a value the
 * term grammar computes, a value written out, and an answer the grammar can name nothing of. The last
 * is the one that matters — it is the only kind whose denotation is nothing at all, so it is the only
 * kind where the recorded subject cannot be read back off what the binding denotes.
