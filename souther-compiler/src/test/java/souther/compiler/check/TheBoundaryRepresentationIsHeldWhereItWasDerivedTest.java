/**

 * <p>Three propositions, and they are one arrangement read from three sides. A declaration as
 * resolution left it says nothing about how a value of it crosses, because there is nowhere on it to
 * say it. A declaration the derivation answered for says it always, because there is no way to make
 * one without saying it. And the way to make one is the derivation, because nothing else can reach
 * the constructor.
 *
 * <p>Held syntactically on purpose. What each of these rules out is a shape rather than a behavior,
 * and a shape is what a later change reaches for first: an {@code Optional} added back to hold "the
 * one we could not derive", a second factory for a declaration somebody wants to put on a surface, a
 * reader given the node where it wanted the representation.
