/**
 * What a name was given is followed to the end, and a reading that follows it does so once.
 *
 * <p>The text behind a name is no longer written down beside it: it is at the end of the chain of
 * names, and reading it walks that chain. Which is a walk per ask, and the readers that ask do so
 * inside a walk of their own — the arithmetic reading asks it of a name, then asks it again of what
 * that name was given, and so on down. Left as it stands, a chain of names costs the square of its
 * length, and nothing about the answers would say so.
 *
 * <p>Held as what the chain costs rather than as how long it takes. Doubling the chain doubles the
 * steps taken while it costs the chain once, and quadruples them while it costs the chain per link;
 * a bound on the number would be a bound on one shape of body, and this is about the shape of the
 * reading.
