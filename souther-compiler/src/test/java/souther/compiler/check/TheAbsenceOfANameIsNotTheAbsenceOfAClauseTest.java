/**
 * A clause written without a name is a clause. What a name decides is whether a diagnostic can send
 * a reader to that clause, and nothing else — so the two sets of names a {@link Judgment} carries
 * are a projection for the diagnostic to write out, and neither of them being empty says anything
 * about whether the type declared such a clause.
 *
 * <p>Held at three layers, because the same conflation can be made again at each of them: what the
 * check decided, what it kept for a diagnostic to name, and which of E2011's spellings a reader is
 * answered in. The check was already holding the first when this was written — {@code verdictOf}
 * counts an unnamed clause as unsettled whether or not it can name it — and the conflation had come
 * back one layer down, where the warning asked the unsettled names whether there were settled ones.
