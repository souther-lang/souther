/**
 * E2010 says a value fails a clause, so what it names is the clauses the value fails.
 *
 * <p>An invariant is a conjunction, and a value that fails one of its clauses may leave others
 * standing that nothing where it is built decides. Those are clauses the guards did not establish,
 * which is what E2011 reports; they are not clauses the value fails. One set was answering both
 * questions, and the sentence that reads it says "the value being built is one that clause rejects"
 * — untrue of every clause in it that was merely left standing.
 *
 * <p>The refinement is of the classification and not of the analysis. What was one answer, unsettled,
 * is now two — unknown and refuted — and the two together are still exactly what unsettled was, so
 * nothing E2011 reports moves.
