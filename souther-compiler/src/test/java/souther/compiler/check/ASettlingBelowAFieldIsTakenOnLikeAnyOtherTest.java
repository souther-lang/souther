/**
 * A coordinate a clause reaches below a field is settled the same way one at a field is.
 *
 * <p>The rules of a record name positions at whatever depth they can reach, so
 * {@code interval.startsAt} is one name and not two. Reading the declaration with such a name
 * settled and taking that settling onto a reading already made have to leave the same thing, or a
 * search that reads once is answering about a position it never fixed.
 *
 * <p><b>Written here rather than left to the models.</b> What the corpora happen to write is what
 * the population this is a case of asks about, and the statement is about the language and not
 * about them: a model rewritten to relate two fields directly would take the whole depth out of
 * that population with nothing to see.
