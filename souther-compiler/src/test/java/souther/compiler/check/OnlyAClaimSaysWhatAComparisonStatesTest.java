/**
 * Who puts a canonical comparison together, and who asks for one.
 *
 * <p>Two questions, and they break differently. What a comparison of two values states is derived
 * from the two facts a claim holds, and that derivation is the claim's: a second one is a table of
 * six that agrees with this one only for as long as somebody keeps it so. Who may ask a claim for
 * the answer is a different matter — a reader that has to write a comparison down asks, and one
 * more of them is one more consumer and not one more derivation.
 *
 * <p><b>What is watched is not written here.</b> Everything that hands back a
 * {@link CanonicalComparison} is read off the compiled classes, and the two questions are the two
 * halves of that: what is declared on the value is how one is assembled, and what is declared
 * anywhere else is how one is asked for. A list of methods written out instead would have a
 * complement — an operation added to the value, an override reached through the arm that declares
 * it rather than through the interface — and what falls in the complement is answered by silence.
 * So the way in is enumerated and then declared, and a way in that nobody has written down is
 * itself the finding.
 *
 * <p><b>What the visibility does not do.</b> {@link CanonicalComparison} is this package's, which
 * keeps it out of the vocabulary anything outside reads. It does not decide who calls what: a
 * method whose answer nothing outside can name is still a method anything can call, so both
 * questions are answered here rather than by the language.
 *
 * <p>Read off the compiled classes, because what a method calls is what the class file says. A
 * reading of the sources would answer the same question a second way, would not see a call written
 * inside a lambda as the method that holds it, and would not see which of an override and the
 * method it overrides a call names.
