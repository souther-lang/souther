/**
 * A state holding nothing, whichever of its domains is the one that holds nothing.
 *
 * <p>A clause reaches whatever domain has a word for it. Some clauses reach more than one — a bound
 * on an {@code Int} is an affine relation and a bound on an order, and each domain abstracts it in a
 * way that is safe on its own — and some reach exactly one: a predicate about a string reaches the
 * facts and says nothing to the numbers, and a date bounded against a written date reaches the
 * ordering and says nothing to either. So a contradiction can be held entirely by one of them while
 * every other is untouched, and a reader asking a single domain whether a value exists answers yes
 * whenever it asked the domain that had never heard of the rules.
 *
 * <p>Each domain is put at its own bottom on its own here, because that is the shape of the mistake:
 * not that the answer was wrong about a state where everything contradicts, but that it was wrong
 * about a state where one thing does.
 *
 * <p>And a state holds nothing for one reason more than a domain finding a contradiction: a caller
 * may have shown it by an argument none of the domains makes
 * ({@link ConstraintState#shownToHoldNothing}). That is put at its own bottom on its own here too,
 * for the same reason as the rest.
