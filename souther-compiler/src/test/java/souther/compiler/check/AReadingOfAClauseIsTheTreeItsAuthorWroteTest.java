/**
 * A reading of a clause stands where the clause does, and a conjunction does not move into a choice.
 *
 * <p>Everything a choice is answerable for is asked of its two alternatives, and an alternative is
 * what an author wrote between the brackets. A conjunction distributed into the branches makes each
 * of them a clause the author did not write — and then the choice reads {@code (x == "A" || x ==
 * "B") && f(y)} as one whose alternatives nothing could read, on the strength of a conjunct written
 * beside it.
 *
 * <p>The rewriting itself is not the defect and is not being removed. Which values a position may
 * take is settled by every clause together, so a branch has to be refined by what was written beside
 * it — over the tree that derives values ({@code StatedTogether}), which is a projection this one
 * cannot be reached from.
 *
 * <p><b>The count of connectives is not the property.</b> Distribution leaves it exactly where it
 * was: {@code (a || b) && c} and {@code (a && c) || (b && c)} have one choice each. So what is held
 * is which node stands under which, down to the identity of every node — and the negative control
 * below is the distributed tree, which a count would accept.
 *
 * <p>Every clause of every model the suite compiles goes through the same predicate, as an assertion
 * where the reading is made. What is here is the predicate itself, with something for it to refuse.
