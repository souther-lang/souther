/**
 * Which readers of a condition cross a binding, which stop at one, and why the two are not the same
 * kind of reader.
 *
 * <p>A rule an author names is expanded where it stands, so a condition written as a call is a
 * binding holding the argument with the rule written against it. There are two kinds of reader of
 * such a condition, and what separates them is what they are handed.
 *
 * <p><b>A reader of a flat condition does not read a binder node.</b> {@link
 * Conditions#comparisonsStatedBy} is handed one expression and asks which comparisons it states; a
 * binding is not a comparison, and it is not that reader's business to say what one means. Handed
 * what is under the binding it states the rule, and handed the binding itself in that same
 * environment it states nothing — so what stops it is the node and never the environment.
 *
 * <p><b>A reader of a whole clause crosses one.</b> A binding is a shape the clause has
 * ({@link ClauseExpr.Scoped}), the fold finds it and {@link ClauseScope} answers for it, and every
 * reading over that shape meets the leaves under it holding what their names mean. A reading is
 * never handed the binding itself: {@link ClauseExpr.Part} is what it is handed, and a binding is
 * not one.
 *
 * <p><b>What a condition taken in makes known is the second kind.</b> It reads three answers off one
 * shape beside what a clause states and which quantifiers it names, so a rule stated through a
 * helper makes known what the same rule written out makes known — in what is entailed, in whether
 * anything was taken in, and in whether the shape was read. It was the first kind until it was
 * written as a reading: it recognised a connective and a denial for itself, had no word for a
 * binding, and a rule an author named made nothing known.
 *
 * <p><b>And the hoist inside the invariant checker is a different job.</b> That one enters a binding
 * standing inside a value — under a field read, under one side of a comparison — so that the value
 * built after it is read under the names the call handed over. It is about what a walk sees next and
 * not about what environment a clause is read in, and it stays where it is.
