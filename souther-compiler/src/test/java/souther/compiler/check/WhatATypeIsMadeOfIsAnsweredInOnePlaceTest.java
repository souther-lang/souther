     * hold both and a loop away is a descent. The declarations are everywhere, so the layer is the
     * part that can be held down, and {@code TypeOps.caseNames} is package-private for that reason.

     * closure at all, and javac says so rather than a scan guessing at spellings.
     *
     * <p>What is left for a scan is the package itself, and it counts <em>calls</em> rather than

     * ask {@link AtomSpace} and this list gets shorter, never longer.
