 * <p>A clause is read once for every place the walk opens a value at, over whatever tree the
 * substitution built there, and two compiles of one source build two trees again. Told apart by the
 * tree, one written part comes back as several things for an author to look at, and which of them a
 * reader is handed is a fact about how the compiler allocated.
 *
 * <p>The two sides of that are held here together, because either alone passes with the wrong
 * answer: sites that are all equal would satisfy the first and sites that are never equal would
