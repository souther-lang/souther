/**
 * Reading a declaration with a coordinate settled and taking the settling onto a reading already
 * made answer the same thing about building a value.
 *
 * <p>What a search choosing one position at a time asks for at each of them is where the value
 * there stops and how many it holds, both under whatever the positions before it took. Those two
 * are the whole of what the rules give it. Read a declaration per position and they are answered by
 * a reading made under the settling; taken onto a reading made once, they are answered by a
 * projection of the constraints that reading came to — and this is the statement that the two are
 * the same question.
 *
 * <p>The statement is what lets one reading serve a whole search. Without it a search that read the
 * declaration once would be answering about the rules as they stood before it chose anything, which
 * is the reading that leaves {@code b} its whole range while {@code a < b} is still open.
