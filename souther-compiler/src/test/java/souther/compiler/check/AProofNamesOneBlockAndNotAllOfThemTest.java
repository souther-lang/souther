/**
 * A state left with no value at more than one block, reported at one of them.
 *
 * <p>Each block says that the positions in it are one value and that value has none. Two of them
 * are two lacks: a sentence over both would say all of their positions are one value, which no rule
 * of the model states. So one is named, and which one is settled by the order the value declares
 * its positions rather than by the order the reading met them.
 *
 * <p>Made here rather than from a declaration. A branch is settled by the first thing that shows it
 * empty and the proof is fixed there, so a clause never reaches the second block — the state that
 * holds both is one a caller builds by conjoining two readings that are each already empty, which
 * is what {@link ConstraintState} has to answer about however it arrives.
