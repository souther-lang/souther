/**
 * A declaration's own reading is made once, however many questions reach the declaration.
 *
 * <p>What its rules leave is read by the count of how many values a module's types have, by the
 * domain of every input a behavior takes, and by every construction of it in a body. Each of those
 * used to read it again, and the readings were the same reading: the same declaration, the same
 * world, the same terms, nothing supposed and nothing left out. So the first is made and the rest
 * are lent it.
 *
 * <p>Held by counting readings rather than by timing them. What a reader is held to is that a
 * second asker reads not at all, which is a shape; a measurement of how long a compile takes would
 * pass on an implementation that had the shape wrong and the machine fast.
 *
 * <p>The lending is of work and not of an answer. A reading is not a value — what it holds is named
 * by identity — so nothing keeps it as one, and what makes handing it on sound is that within a
 * revision there is one world for it to be a reading of. When an input is given a value it did not
 * hold, that is a new world and what was lent is dropped, which the last of these holds.
