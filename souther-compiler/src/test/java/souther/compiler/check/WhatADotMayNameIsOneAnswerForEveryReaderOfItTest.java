/**
 * What a {@code .} written on a value may name, and who says so.
 *
 * <p>Two questions stand either side of this one and neither is it. What a value of a declaration is
 * <em>laid out</em> as is {@link FieldTypes}', and a sum lays out nothing — a value of it is a value
 * of one of its cases. What a value standing here makes <em>readable</em> is this, and at a sum it is
 * the names every one of its cases spreads, because every value of it carries them. The two are one
 * map at a record, which is what makes taking the first for the second look right until a sum
 * arrives.
 *
 * <p>So the reading is {@link FieldRead}'s, and the readers that cross a {@code .} — the elaboration
 * that types what a text wrote, the walk that says what declarations already state about an
 * expression, the snapshot an editor asks what may follow a {@code .} — read it rather than each
 * working out a surface of its own. The last of these is why the agreement is checked and not left
 * to follow from one implementation: an author offered a name the compiler will refuse, or refused a
 * name it accepts, is the defect whichever of the two is right.
