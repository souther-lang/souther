/**
 * Which of a choice's alternatives its width rests on is read off what they leave.
 *
 * <p>A choice admits whatever either of its alternatives admits, so what it leaves without one of
 * them is contained in what it leaves with both: differing there is being narrower, and a position
 * the two of them leave alike is one neither alternative is answerable for the width of. That is
 * the whole rule, and it is the same rule whether one alternative was read whole, both were, or
 * neither — which is what lets the account ask a single question of it.
 *
 * <p>Asked of the descriptions and answered by their normal forms. Nothing is built to answer it,
 * so a choice costs no more for being asked; two descriptions of one set that were written
 * differently come out apart, and the position is kept as one the width may rest on.
