/**
 * A question a rule leaves standing is accounted for by a reading or by the answer, and the two are
 * told apart.
 *
 * <p>Three causes reach one outcome and only two of them are about a rule. A rule whose form no
 * reading takes apart is the reading's own account; a rule read in full whose exact answer ran past
 * the allowance is an account of the answer, which no rule is answerable for
 * ({@link ReadingEvidence#stoppedBy} refuses to file one). A question with neither is the accounting
 * disagreeing with itself and is refused where it is made.
 *
 * <p>The third case is what this is for. Reaching an admitted-values question with no reading having
 * recognised the rule's positions was one, and a helper was the way to it: the clause was read at
 * the names the expansion's binding introduced and every reading passed over it. Going inside the
 * binding closed that (ADR-0106), so the helper here is held to answering as the rule written out
 * does — and the answer-level case is held beside it, so that closing one is not read as the other
 * having gone away.
