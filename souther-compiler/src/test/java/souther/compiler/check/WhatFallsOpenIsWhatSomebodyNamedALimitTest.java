/**
 * The discharge check falls open on the limits it named and on nothing else.
 *
 * <p>It used to fall open on whatever a walk threw, so a representation refusing to be built and a
 * shape the walk has no rule for arrived as one thing: both a {@code RuntimeException} from the same
 * call, both read as "nothing could be analysed here", and the compile went on with the invariant
 * quietly undischarged. A reader of what came out had no way back to which of the two it was.
 *
 * <p>What is held here is the other direction. A limit exists because something with the standing to
 * say so made one, and a failure nobody made one of is not a limit — it leaves the analysis as what
 * it is. The two halves of that are held apart, because either alone is satisfied by a check that
 * gives up on everything or by one that gives up on nothing.
