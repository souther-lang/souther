/**
 * A published declaration says something else when the declaration does, and the same thing when it
 * only moved.
 *
 * <p>What the audit beside this cannot see. Reading every component a declaration says is not the
 * same as carrying what they say: a producer that gathered the fields into a map would read both of
 * them and publish an answer two declarations laid out differently share, and every accessor it
 * called would be accounted for. So the order the parts are in is held here, by editing a
 * declaration in a way that changes nothing else.
 *
 * <p>Each edit below changes one thing. What a reader elsewhere is told has to move with the four
 * that change what the declaration says, and stay put for the one that changes only where it is.
