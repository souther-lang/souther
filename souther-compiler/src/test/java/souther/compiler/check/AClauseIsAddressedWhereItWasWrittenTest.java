/**
 * A clause is addressed by where the clause was written, which is not where its condition was.
 *
 * <p>Two regions are in reach at every site that reports one of these, and they are answers to
 * different questions. The expression's covers the condition and stops there, so the name the author
 * gave the clause is outside it — and that name is what the message says. The clause's covers the
 * clause, name and all. A report that named {@code even} and underlined {@code isEven(value)} would
 * leave the reader to work out that the two are one clause.
 *
 * <p>The second half is that the clause keeps its own answer through the rewriting the discharge
 * analysis does. The clauses that analysis reads have had the helpers they name expanded into them,
 * and every stage that rewrites one goes through {@link Hir.InvariantClause#with}. Nothing about a
 * diagnostic makes that visible: a clause whose address moved would still be reported, at a place
 * that reads as a rule.
