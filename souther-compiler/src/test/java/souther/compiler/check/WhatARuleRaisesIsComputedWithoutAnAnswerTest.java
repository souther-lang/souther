/**
 * Which coverage questions a rule raises is computed without asking anything that answers one.
 *
 * <p>For a fixed model and a fixed reading of what that model means, what a rule raises does not
 * depend on the readers that answer: not on what they can do, not on whether they succeeded, and
 * not on any value they produced. A reading of the model growing able to understand more may change
 * the classification — proving that a clause restricts no value is understanding the clause better,
 * and a question that goes away because the model turned out to say nothing is a question nobody
 * was owed. What may never change it is a reader having failed.
 *
 * <p><b>Why it is the computation and not the value.</b> A question carries nothing a reading
 * produced, and that is said elsewhere over the types those values are made of
 * ({@link ARaisedQuestionCarriesNoReaderProducedValueTest}). It is not enough here: a
 * classification could hold nothing but an arm and still have chosen that arm by asking whether a
 * bound could be read. The value would be clean and the answer would have decided the question. So
 * what is walked is what the classification computes with — every method reachable from the ones
 * that produce it, through the calls a class file records.
 *
 * <p><b>And the roots are the producers, not the entry.</b> What a rule raises is
 * {@link Required#ofInvariant}'s of what a clause was found to state, and that finding is handed in
 * rather than made there. Rooted at the entry alone, everything that made its arguments would be
 * outside the walk — which is where an answer would get in, and the check would pass by looking at
 * the wrong half.
 *
 * <p><b>What is forbidden is what answering produces.</b> Not every type an answer also uses: a
 * carrier is the order a declared type's values live on, and the readings of ends use it exactly as
 * the reading of what a clause states does — refusing it would be refusing a shared vocabulary
 * rather than a dependency. The list below is values that exist because something answered a
 * question or read the evidence for one.
