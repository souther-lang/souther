 * one means, composed so that the rule can be read as the comparison it states. Giving it the
 * written call's own identity would put two applications under one, so it is a name and an
 * application of that pass's — each derived from the one the call it is read off reached.
 *
 * <p>Which makes what it derives from the question. A call an author wrote and one a generator
 * composed are two different things to have been read off, and the answer says which: composed is
 * not the same answer as saying nothing, and a reader telling only "does this have an identity"
 * from "which of the three is it" reports the second as the first.
