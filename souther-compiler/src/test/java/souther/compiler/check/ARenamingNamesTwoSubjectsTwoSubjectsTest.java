/**
 * A state said in another vocabulary keeps two subjects two subjects.
 *
 * <p>Which is not what {@link NumericDomain#over} does. That is a fold: two atoms arriving at one
 * name are one number and their coefficients are added, because a caller writing
 * {@code List.length(xs) + Set.size(xs)} wrote two spellings of one count. Right of a form and wrong
 * of a state — two positions under one name would bound each other, hold each other's values and
 * settle each other's predicates, which is the reading saying what nobody wrote.
 *
 * <p><b>And the rule is about the whole vocabulary, not about each domain.</b> A subject may sit in
 * one domain and no other: a predicate the numbers have no word for, a position only an ordering
 * bounds. So a naming that is injective on every domain read by itself can still put two subjects
 * under one name, and nothing that sees one domain can tell. That is the case below, and it is the
 * one a check written per domain would let through.
