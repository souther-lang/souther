/**
 * What a choice with a branch nobody can be in leaves does not follow the brackets.
 *
 * <p>A choice between two branches that stand is composed by the values, and that it is one
 * connective rather than a tree is held of that operation
 * ({@code AChoiceIsOneConnectiveAndNotATreeTest}). A branch nobody can be in is not composed at
 * all: which branches those are is a question about the values and the order together, so it is
 * settled by the holder of both, and what the values are asked for is either the settlement of two
 * dead branches or nothing at all.
 *
 * <p>So the property has two halves and this is the other one. Written the way the holder settles
 * them — every branch dead is a settlement, one dead leaves the standing branch as it stands —
 * three alternatives leave the same answer however they are bracketed and whatever order they were
 * written in. Lost, a declaration refused for reasons nobody can be in would answer one way to the
 * left of the brackets and another to the right.
 *
 * <p>The same property over what a report may say of such a choice is
 * {@link AChoiceReadsTheRuleAndNotTheTreeItIsWrittenAsTest}.
