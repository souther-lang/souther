 * measures is the second: a rule is answered where some reading took it in, whatever it made of it.
 * Written down here as a grid rather than as two tests, because the pairs that disagree are the whole
 * content — a measure that read either off the other would be right on the rows that agree and would
 * promise a row nobody can build on the rows that do not.
