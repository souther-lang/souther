/**
 * A report about a clause points at the clause.
 *
 * <p>A name is not the only way to send a reader to one. A clause an author wrote no name on is
 * judged like any other, and the warning about it used to say "its invariant" and stop — which left
 * the reader the type's declaration to read and the clauses in it to work through, for a check that
 * knew exactly which one it had left standing.
 *
 * <p>What is pointed at follows the classification and not the message: E2011 is about the clauses
 * the guards did not establish, E2010 about the ones the value fails. Whether a clause can be named
 * and whether a reader can be sent to it are separate questions, so neither of them decides the
 * other here.
