/**

 * other holds. Asked one at a time, they answer that a value exists whenever the one that was asked
 * had nothing to say about the rules — which is how {@code String.startsWith("JP", value)} beside
 * {@code value < "JA"} was accepted, the strings and the ends sharing none.
 *
 * <p>What was wrong was not any one of the places that asked. The sentence saying either language
 * could hold the whole answer on its own was written in five of them, so forbidding the spelling
 * would leave a sixth to be written. What is checked here is that there is no type left holding the
 * two apart: a reader with both halves in hand is a reader that can compose them, and the halves are
