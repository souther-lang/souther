/**

 *
 * <p>A name is what it was given, so the text behind it is however many names away it was written —
 * which the walk already records, one binding at a time. Kept beside the denotation as well, the same
 * fact was held twice: once as what the binding stands for and once as the text a reading of it
 * folded, and the two had to be made to agree at every place a binding is entered.
 *
 * <p>Followed by what a name was given and not by what it denotes. A binding is what it was given
 * whatever kind of thing that is, so the rule is one rule — a {@code match} arm opening a value
 * written into the source opens that written value, and it is written there for the same reason the
 * name it was given is.
