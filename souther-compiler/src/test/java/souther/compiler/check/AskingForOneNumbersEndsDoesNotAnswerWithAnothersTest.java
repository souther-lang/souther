/**
 * Ends placed on one number of a position are not answered with another number's.
 *
 * <p>Asked of the selector and not of the values it selects between. That two coordinates at one
 * path are two values is the record's own business and is true the moment the operation is carried;
 * what regressed before is the reading beside it — {@code d.path().equals(where.path()) &&
 * d.measured() == where.measured()}, which is two projections agreeing rather than two numbers
 * being one. A selector written that way again passes every test that only compares identities.
 *
 * <p>{@link DeclaredBounds#placed} is where that selector is. It took a boolean and takes a
 * {@link BoundaryClaim.OfWhatNumber}, and the path is the caller's already — {@code placedAt(path)}
 * is what the list is — so the kind is the whole of what it has to tell apart.
 *
 * <p>Two operations over one path is not a shape the language writes today, because a shape declares
 * one number taken of it ({@code NumericMeasures.takenOf}). That is why this is asked here rather
 * than of a model: the day a second is declared is the day a rule about one comes back as a bound on
 * the other, and nothing about either looks like a failure.
