 * admits. When one of those machines is refused, what is recorded is a fact about the pattern
 * somebody wrote — and where it is recorded is the position, which is what the spending is arranged
 * by. Which rule asked is not the same question as which rules name the place, and an account that
 * answered the first with the second told an author to go and change a rule that is not why.
 *
 * <p>Two things are lost by asking the position, and both are here. Which rule is answerable is one.
 * Where the reason stands among the parts the author wrote is the other: a limit recovered from a
 * position has no place among them, and a reading that hands its reasons on in the order the author
 * wrote them cannot put it back.
