 * at two and a row at two is a row at a line the model draws. Written with {@code &&} between them
 * the same two bounds are a line this compiler draws, and written alone either of them is — so a
 * choice coming back as a rule that draws none was a sentence about the model, and the model draws
 * one.
 *
 * <p><b>Not a list of shapes.</b> What each of these holds is where an answer comes from: what a
 * choice leaves a position is settled once, where the branches have their fate, and every reader
 * that draws a line is reading that one answer. A shape below that came back short would be a
 * second reading of the same choice, arrived at by whichever road the model happened to take.
