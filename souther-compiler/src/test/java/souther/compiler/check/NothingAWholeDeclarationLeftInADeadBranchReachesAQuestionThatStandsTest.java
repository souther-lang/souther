 * <p>Which is a claim about a whole declaration and needs a question that stands to be told to.
 * Held over a branch nothing else names, both would be true of a reading that kept everything: the
 * positions the dead branch spoke of are settled, so no question about them is left for what it
 * kept to reach. So the branch that stands here names the position too, and the position hears
 * about a rule of the declaration or about how wide it is — and what the dead branch was holding
 * would arrive at that question if it were kept.
 *
 * <p>Each of them beside the same model with the branch standing, which is where the reading does
 * say both things. What is under test is that a fate decides it, and a pair of models one fate
