/**
 * A binding is where the environment a clause is read in changes, and it is not a leaf.
 *
 * <p>What a clause states is answered upward and what its names mean is handed downward. Held as a
 * fold with only the first direction, there was nowhere a binding could be, so it arrived at every
 * evaluator as a shape none of them had a word for — and since a helper call expands to a binding
 * holding the argument and the helper's body written against it, that is every rule an author stated
 * by naming it.
 *
 * <p>Over the shape and the fold rather than over a compiled module, because what is fixed here is
 * that no evaluator is ever handed a binding: an evaluator that learned to read one would be a
 * second account of what a binder means, which is the environment's ({@code ADR-0106}). The
 * environment is a string so that the transitions can be read off the answer — what it is in the
 * check is {@link Denotations}, and what makes one is {@link Terms#inside}.
