/**
 * Which branches of a choice anybody can be in is the whole declaration's answer, and what a rule
 * left unread is that rule's own.
 *
 * <p>The two pull the reading in different directions and both hold at once. A branch live on its
 * own clause can be impossible under a clause written later, so the decision waits for every clause
 * — and a branch nobody anywhere can be in takes its unread rules with it, since there is no branch
 * for an author to look at. But a clause a neighbour wrote does not read this rule's alternatives
 * for it: whether an alternative of this rule went unread is answered over this rule's clauses
 * alone, or the gap is hidden by a constraint that happens to stand beside it
 * ({@code EveryPartAReadingStoppedOnSaysWhyTest} holds that end).
 *
 * <p>And a branch's fate is aggregated over every place distribution put it. The same written
 * choice stands inside each branch of every choice met with it, live in one place and dead in
 * another — dead is only dead everywhere, and the aggregate cannot depend on the order the clauses
 * were written in.
