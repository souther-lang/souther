/**
 * What a rule is answerable for is carried from where the asking is, and never sifted out of what a
 * place was left holding.
 *
 * <p>A position says what it was left holding and says it for every reason there is. Sifting those
 * for the ones a rule could be answerable for gives a list of reasons and no rule: an allowance is
 * the position's and every rule reaching it pays in, so what comes back is every rule that named the
 * place, standing in for the one that asked.
 *
 * <p>Closing a call site leaves the sift behind — a method on a finished reading that does exactly
 * it, unused and one call away from being put back. So what is held is the sift itself: naming
 * {@link souther.compiler.values.UnreadReason.About#A_RULE} is how a caller separates the two kinds,
 * and the places entitled to are counted.
 *
 * <p><b>A tripwire and not a proof.</b> A second sift written inside one of the files below passes
 * this, and so does one written without naming the classification. What it stops is the shape that
 * was actually there: a reading answering what a rule is answerable for by filtering its own
 * position's reasons.
