 * <p>The pair is the contract {@link AffineForms.ReadThrough} already states: a value stands for a
 * name in the environment the binding was made in, which is not always the one the name was read
 * in. An answer that carries the expression alone puts the caller in the position of reading it
 * again in whatever it happens to hold — which is the same reading done twice, and free to disagree
 * with this one the day the two environments come apart.
 *
 * <p>Asked of the walk directly rather than of a model, because no model this compiler accepts
 * tells the two environments apart yet. A test written over one would pass on the coincidence and
 * say nothing about the contract.
