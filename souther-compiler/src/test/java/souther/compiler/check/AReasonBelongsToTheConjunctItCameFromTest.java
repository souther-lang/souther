/**
 * Why a line went unread is the conjunct's answer, and not the one written beside it.
 *
 * <p>A rule is read a conjunct at a time. {@code x <= 10 * 2 && x <= y} has one conjunct that draws
 * a line this compiler could not fold and one that relates two positions and draws none, and both
 * are recorded at the same position of the same rule. Asked of the rule and the position, the answer
 * was whichever the walk wrote first — so the same model said two different things about why its
 * line went unread depending on the order its conjuncts are written in.
 *
 * <p>Which is the reason the accounting asks per conjunct everywhere else: the evidence is per
 * conjunct, so what it says is too.
