/**
 * Who may say that this check met a limit, and what each of them met.
 *
 * <p>The discharge check falls open on a limit and never on a failure, and which of the two
 * something is, is decided where it was met rather than at the boundary that records it. So what
 * matters is who may make one of these — a {@link WhatTheCheckCannotRead} — and that is a decision
 * about the analysis rather than something an access modifier settles: a factory a package can reach
 * is one anything in that package can call.
 *
 * <p><b>What this holds and what it does not.</b> It says who makes a limit today and what each of
 * them is for; a new maker lands here and has to be written down as one of them, which is where the
 * decision gets read. It does not say that a broad {@code catch} can never come back — a
 * {@code catch} of everything inside an existing maker would leave these numbers where they are.
 * That is held by the shape of the ways in instead: every one of them names what was met, and none
 * takes a {@code Throwable}, so wrapping an arbitrary failure means writing a way in that says it
 * does.
