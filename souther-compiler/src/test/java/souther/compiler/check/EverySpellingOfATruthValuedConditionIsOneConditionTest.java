/**
 * A condition of two values says the same thing however it is written against a truth value.
 *
 * <p>What a reading below is given is an atom and a polarity, and the ways of arriving at one are
 * the language's rather than each reader's: {@code p}, {@code p == true}, {@code p /= false} and a
 * denial of the denial of any of them are one condition, and the four with the polarity turned over
 * are the other. A reader that learned a spelling at a time would answer for the ones somebody had
 * got to, and the answers below are what such a gap looks like from outside — a body's arm the rules
 * prove nothing reaches is owed a row under one spelling and not under the next.
 *
 * <p>Read off the arms rather than off the values a position admits. What the rule says about the
 * position is what makes the arm unreachable, so the arm account is downstream of the whole reading
 * — and a test on the values would pass over a reading that answered them and never reached the
 * body.
