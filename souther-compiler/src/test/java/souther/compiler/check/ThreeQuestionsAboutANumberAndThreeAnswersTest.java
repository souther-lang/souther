/**
 * What a number is, asked three ways, of the same six types.
 *
 * <p>They read alike and they are not one question. The first is what gives a <em>newtype</em> closed
 * arithmetic, which the language grants only for one directly over a number and means to (spec
 * §newtype-arithmetic) — it is not "arithmetic works here", which is also true of a bare `Int`, and
 * the column is named for what it measures so the table does not repeat the confusion it is about.
 * Being an ordered number reaches the recursive base, which is what a comparison reads (ADR-0047).
 * Whether the affine domain can carry a value is the analyser's own capability, and answering it with
 * the first is how a comparison the language accepts stopped reaching the reasoning (#461).
 *
 * <p>Held as a table because the three coincide on most types and part on exactly the ones that
 * matter. A change to any of them shows here as a cell, and which cell says whether the language's
 * capability moved or the analyser's did.
