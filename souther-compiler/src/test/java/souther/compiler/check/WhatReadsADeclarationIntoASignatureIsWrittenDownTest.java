/**
 * Who reads a declaration into a signature, and who hands one on.
 *
 * <p>A {@link DeclaredOperation} is a name that has been read against the declaration it reaches,
 * and everything downstream of it stands on that having happened: a call keeps the arguments its
 * declaration takes, and a reader finding one of them by a position some rule names is finding a
 * position that declaration has. So what may say a declaration was read is the question, and it is
 * asked here rather than answered by an access modifier — a constructor a package can reach is one
 * anything in that package can call.
 *
 * <p><b>Two steps, and both are counted.</b> Counting what builds a {@code DeclaredOperation} alone
 * would leave the step above it open: everything that builds one goes through
 * {@link CompleteSignature}, so a caller that made a signature out of a name and a list of its own
 * choosing would reach a {@code DeclaredOperation} through the one path this admits. What has to be
 * known is every way a signature comes to be, which is the first test below.
 *
 * <p><b>Assembling and asking are not the same finding.</b> A method handing back a signature is
 * either making one out of a declaration or handing on one that was made — {@link Preserved} keeps
 * the ones the library was read into and answers with them. One more of the second is one more
 * reader and says nothing about who may read a declaration; one more of the first is a new
 * authority, which is what this is watching for.
 *
 * <p>Read off the compiled classes. A constructor call is in the calling class's constant pool
 * whatever it is spelled like, and a lambda's body is compiled into the class that wrote it, so a
 * caller cannot get out of this by writing the call somewhere shorter.
