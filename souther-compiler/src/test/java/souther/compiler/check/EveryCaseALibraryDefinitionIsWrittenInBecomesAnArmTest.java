/**
 * Every case an operation of the library is defined in comes out of {@link Choice} as an arm, with
 * the argument that case answers and every relation it is reached under.
 *
 * <p>Row by row and not operation by operation. What a reader downstream needs of a case is the
 * value and the conditions together: the value alone says {@code Int.clamp(lo, hi, n)} may answer
 * {@code hi}, and only the conditions say when — so an implementation that moved every answer across
 * and dropped one relation would leave a choice whose arms are all reachable, bounded by a span over
 * values it cannot take. Counting arms would pass that; this does not.
 *
 * <p>Held against the table rather than against a copy of it written out here. What is under test is
 * the reading, not the library: a second copy of the cases in this file would be the drift the
 * reading was moved into one place to stop, and it would go stale the day {@code clamp} is defined
 * differently while proving nothing about whether anyone noticed.
 *
 * <p>Every operation the table has, so the day one is added it is read here without being named.
