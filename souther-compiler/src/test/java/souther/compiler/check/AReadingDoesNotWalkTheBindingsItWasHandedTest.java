/**
 * What a walk is handed about the bindings in force where it starts is asked after, one binding at a
 * time, and never gone through.
 *
 * <p>What is handed over is what a module's declarations say about every parameter its behaviors
 * wrote. It is worked out once for a revision and handed to every walk made against it, so a walk
 * that went through it would cost what the module is however small the question was — which is the
 * whole of what asking it once was for. An editor asks one of these per keystroke.
 *
 * <p>Held here rather than where the table is worked out, because this is where it would be undone:
 * a walk keeps its own bindings as it enters them, and seeding that from what it was handed is one
 * line, reads as housekeeping, and puts the cost back where a check on the table being answered once
 * cannot see it. So the table arrives as something that answers a binding and refuses to be walked.
