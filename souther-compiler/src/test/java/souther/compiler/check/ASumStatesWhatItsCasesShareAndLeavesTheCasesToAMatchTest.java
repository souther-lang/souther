/**
 * A sum is a common product times a choice of case, and the reading of one says both.
 *
 * <p>What every case spreads is stated of every value standing at the sum: a value of the sum was
 * built through one case's checked constructor, and every case carries the shared declaration, so
 * what that declaration writes holds here. What one case writes does not — it refuses values of that
 * case and not every value here — so it stays for the reading a {@code match} opens.
 *
 * <p><b>The two are independent, and this is the test that says so.</b> Each row below fixes one
 * combination of the two, and the pair in {@code aSumCanBothStateARuleAndLeaveOneToItsCases} is the
 * one an answer with a single arm cannot hold: dropping what is read here and dropping what is left
 * to the cases each turn a different assertion red.
