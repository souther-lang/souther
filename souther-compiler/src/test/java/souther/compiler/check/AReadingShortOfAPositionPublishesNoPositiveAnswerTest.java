/**
 * A reading with a position nobody could build says nothing about whether anything satisfies it.
 *
 * <p>What stands at such a position is every value, which is true and is wider than the rules. So a
 * walk that found no refusal there found none because nothing was asked, and the settled positive
 * answer it came back with is about less than the rules say.
 *
 * <p><b>The same rules twice, and only the allowance differs.</b> A reading whose values admit
 * nothing answers the same however little was built, and one nothing worked out was never going to
 * answer positively — so a fixture that showed either would show this rule holding where it does
 * nothing. What is asked here is a reading that does come out positive when there is room to build
 * it, asked again with room for less.
 *
 * <p>And asked wherever the reading is asked. What a reading could not build is a fact about that
 * reading and not about the question that reached it, so a conjunction that took the reading in
 * answers under it too — otherwise which answer comes back is settled by how far from the reading
 * the caller happens to be standing.
