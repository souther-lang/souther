/**
 * What one field's rule is written as does not decide what another field owes.
 *
 * <p>A row at a point is a whole value with that point in it, so composing one has to fill every
 * position of the record. A field whose rule nothing could turn into a set of strings was a field
 * nothing could compose a value for, and the row that would have stood at a sibling's boundary was
 * never built — which the account then read as the sibling not being owed a row at all. Adding a
 * field took a debt off a field two lines away, and a model measured one day stopped being measured
 * the next (issue #1249).
 *
 * <p>Held over the predicates a domain writes about strings, each beside the same length rule. The
 * five say different things and none of them says anything about the length of another field, so
 * the account under each of them is the same account.
