/**
 * A copy of a body is written under the copy it stands in, all the way down.
 *
 * <p>One helper called at two places is two copies, and everything inside each of them belongs to
 * the copy it is in. So a call written once inside that helper is one call the author wrote and two
 * expansions in the tree that runs — the same site under two different parents — and the bindings
 * each of them writes are its own.
 *
 * <p><b>Told by what the source wrote and never by the order the copies were made.</b> Which calls a
 * pass expands is what the policy it runs under decides, so a count over the expansions of one body
 * runs differently in the tree a backend emits and the tree an analysis reads. What is here comes
 * from the source: which application it is, and which copy it is inside.
 *
 * <p>Both halves are checked, and neither says anything alone. That two expansions of one call are
 * different is only interesting while they agree about which call it is; that they agree about the
 * call is only a property while they are two.
