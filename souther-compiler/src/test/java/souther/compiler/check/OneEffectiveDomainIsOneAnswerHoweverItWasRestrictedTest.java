/**
 * Two restrictions coming to the same values are one question, whichever of them was written down.
 *
 * <p>What a search for a value is given is a set the declarations leave and a run of the order, and
 * what it is asked about is the values in both. So the same values reached by putting the restriction
 * in the set and by putting it in the run are the same question, and a value written out for one is a
 * value written out for the other.
 *
 * <p>Which they are not. A set that names a language is crossed with the run as a machine and a
 * string is read out of it wherever the run leaves one; a set that names every value but a few has no
 * machine built for it here, and the walk that stands in offers the least string and then longer ones
 * built from a letter — none of which is inside a run away from that handful. So a rule written as a
 * comparison comes back with no value where the same rule written as a prefix comes back with one,
 * and a report says nothing could build a representative for a run holding as many strings as there
 * are.
 *
 * <p>The shapes are right to differ; a set naming its values and a set naming a language are not
 * searched the same way. What is wrong is that the difference reaches the answer, which is a step a
 * reader of the model cannot see.
 *
 * <p><b>About a witness that can be written, and not about which one.</b> What this order hands back
 * is a value a source can carry ({@link souther.compiler.regex.Language#someWritten}), so what has to
 * agree is whether one exists — two searches may write out different strings. And where an allowance
 * ran out there is no answer to agree about: that is an explicit limit and not evidence that the run
 * holds nothing, which is why it is told apart here rather than read off a null.
