/**
 * What a published declaration says is everything the declaration says, and none of where it stands.
 *
 * <p>Two things {@link DeclarationMeaning} has to be, and only one of them is the one that is easy
 * to see.
 * A meaning that read where a declaration stands makes a module that imports it depend on an edit it
 * cannot see. A meaning that left out something the declaration says makes two declarations that say
 * different things one dependency, and the store then stops the work of everything that read the one
 * it kept — which is the worse of the two, and the one a check written only about what a meaning
 * ignores would never fail on.
 *
 * <p><b>The population is the components, as the records declare them.</b> The switch being over a
 * sealed type says a kind added later arrives as a compile error; it says nothing about a component
 * added to a kind that is already there. So each component is asked which of the two it is, and a
 * component that is neither — or that is new and nobody classified — fails here rather than being
 * quietly left out of what a module elsewhere is told.
 *
 * <p><b>A component whose type is a written name is neither.</b> {@link WrittenName} holds what a
 * name is (its canonical form) beside how and where it was spelled, so a rule that admitted the type
 * would publish the spelling and one that refused it would drop the name. Those are read through
 * {@link #SAYS_THROUGH}, and what the producer may call on a {@code WrittenName} is held separately.
 *
 * <p>Read off the compiled producer rather than off its text: which accessors it calls is what the
 * class file says, and reading the source would be answering the same question a second way.
