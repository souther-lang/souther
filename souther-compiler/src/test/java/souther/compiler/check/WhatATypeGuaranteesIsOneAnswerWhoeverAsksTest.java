/**
 * What a declaration guarantees, asked of the reading itself.
 *
 * <p>{@link TypeGuarantees} answers one question for every reader there is: a walk seeding a path,
 * and a recipe settling a choice. Each of those has tests of its own about what it does with the
 * answer, and those are the tests that pass while the answer is wrong — a walk can agree with itself
 * about a declaration it reads two levels too shallowly. So the answer is held here, on its own.
 *
 * <p>What is fixed is what a position guarantees and where the positions are. How far a reader goes
 * is not fixed and may not be: two readers walking to different depths are still reading one model,
 * and requiring one depth would put a reader's affordance inside what a declaration means. What is
 * required instead is the last test here — where two scopes both looked, they were told the same
 * thing.
