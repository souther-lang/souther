/**
 * What a choice admits and which rules were read are two answers, and one model gives opposite ones.
 *
 * <p>An alternative that admits every value at a position settles it, so a rule offered beside it
 * adds nothing a value could fail — and the position is one the reading speaks for however little
 * of that rule it could take in. The rule is still one nobody read, and the accounting says so.
 *
 * <p><b>The two are not in disagreement and are not to be made to agree.</b> Which values may stand
 * at a position is about the values, and a rule that could have narrowed them but did not is no
 * part of that answer. Which reading took a rule in is about the rules, and a rule nothing had a
 * word for was taken in by nothing whatever the values came to. A reading that carried the first
 * answer into the second would report a rule as read on the evidence that it did not matter.
