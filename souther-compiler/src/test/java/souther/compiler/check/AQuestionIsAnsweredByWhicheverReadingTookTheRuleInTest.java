/**

 *
 * <p>Which is what issue #842 is about, and the trap it sets. The reading that turns a clause into a
 * set of values has no word for a range, so it is short of the rules at every numeric position an
 * invariant bounds — and the report was printing that as the model having gone unread, two lines
 * above the boundary drawn from one of the very rules the sentence was about.
 *
 * <p>The trap is that there are more readings than the two a reader notices. {@code value * 2 >= 4}
 * is beyond the reading of ends and beyond the reading of values, and the reading that builds the
 * numeric constraints takes it in whole — so a model carrying it is fully read, and an accounting
 * that consulted two readings would report it exactly as #842 reports a bound. The table below is
 * what separates them, and every row of it was measured before it was written down.
