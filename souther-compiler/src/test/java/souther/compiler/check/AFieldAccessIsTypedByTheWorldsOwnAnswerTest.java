 * enters, a name it follows, a definition it steps into. What a field of a declaration holds is not
 * that walk's to work out: an accepted program has one answer to it and it is the check's, and a
 * walk deriving a second from the declarations would be the reading a comparison is made against
 * and the reading a projection is typed by coming apart.
 *
 * <p>Held to by a world that answers something the declarations do not. The walk has the
 * declarations in hand — it resolves names against them — so an answer that follows the world it
