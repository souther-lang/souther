/**
 * An edge the question being asked does not cross is not an edge nobody wrote down.
 *
 * <p>Both leave a walk with no binding to go on to, and only one of them leaves it free to look
 * elsewhere. Where nothing was recorded, what the binding holds is the only thing there is to read
 * and reading it is how a container bound to a value is followed. Where an edge says the values were
 * made from another binding's, the walk after which position a value <em>is</em> has been told to
 * stop — and what the binding holds is the very thing it was told to stop before, since the value a
 * rewrite left under such a name is what the walk before it made.
 *
 * <p>Answered alike, the stop is read as an absence and the second road is taken: the reading
 * arrives at the position the earlier walk read, which is the one answer this must never give. That
 * a body compiled today does not reach it is a fact about the shape one rewrite happens to leave,
 * which is what nothing here is allowed to depend on.
 *
 * <p>Written out rather than compiled, because what is held is that the two answers are different
 * whatever a body can be written to say.
