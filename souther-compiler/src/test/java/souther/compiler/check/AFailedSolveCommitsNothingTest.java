 * What a solving walk leaves behind when it does not fit.

 * positions it had already settled were settled by a reading the walk went on to refuse. Every
 * caller that tries a solve it may not keep reads the same map afterwards, and a caller cannot tell
 * a variable this walk settled from one that was there before. So a walk that does not fit settles
