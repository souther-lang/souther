/**
 * A branch this could not work out is kept, and what it left is not claimed as read.
 *
 * <p>Two patterns that share no string leave a branch nothing satisfies, and nothing knows that
 * until both machines are made and met. Where the meet is more than this compiler will build, the
 * position comes back holding every value — and the branch, asked whether it admits anything, looks
 * like one somebody can be in.
 *
 * <p>Keeping it is right: nothing showed it empty, so dropping it would answer a model from
 * something this compiler failed to work out. What is not right is keeping it quietly. The account
 * of what each clause took in is written before any machine is made, so the branch arrives claiming
 * to have read its rules — and the reading beside it is then answered as though the choice had been
 * read from end to end, at a position where the truth is that nobody looked.
 *
 * <p>So the three facts settle together. What the position admits, whether the branch admits
 * anything, and which limit stopped the work are one piece of work and travel as one.
