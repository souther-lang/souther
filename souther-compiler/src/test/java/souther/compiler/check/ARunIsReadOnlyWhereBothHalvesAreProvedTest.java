 * proved by different owners.
 *
 * <p>One half is about the operation: a walk answers exactly one closure result per element of what
 * it was given. The other is about the closure: what it answered is a place inside the element it
 * was applied to. Either alone licenses nothing, and this holds each of them by a model that has one
 * and not the other.
 *
 * <p>The join between them is a binding, so it is held too: what the rewritten walk hands out has to
 * be the binding the projection was recorded against, or the lookup finds somebody else's proof or
