 * stand at the position and about where they stop. What the model states is the same in both: an
 * ordering comparison of the position against an expression naming no position. What differs is
 * whether this compiler can fold the other side to a number, and that is a fact about this
 * compiler.
 *
 * <p>It used to decide whether the model had asked. {@code BOUNDARY} was raised out of a
 * {@code ClauseStates} arm built where {@code InvariantBound.at} came back with an end, so a clause
 * the end reading could not take in left no question standing and the accounting for it came back
 * complete. A question nothing raises is one every model answers by nobody having asked, which is
 * what {@link CoverageObligation} says of itself it is not for.
 *
 * <p>So the question is raised off the shape and the reading answers it. The pair below is the whole
 * of the difference: one line, two clauses, one question each, and one of them left standing.
