/**
 * A declaration's fields are bound where the declaration is written, and every reader gets those
 * bindings.
 *
 * <p>A clause reads its declaration's fields as the bindings they are, and it is resolved once, by
 * the module that wrote it. A reader that computes those bindings under its own module name gets a
 * different binding for the same field, so the clause it was carried in with resolves against
 * nothing — and {@code Clauses.typed} answers null, which every caller reads as a rule the language
 * cannot express rather than one that was looked up in the wrong place.
 *
 * <p>Held over each way a reader can reach a declaration another module wrote. They break together
 * today and need not stay that way: how a name arrives is the import representation's business, and
 * a binding is not a function of it.
 *
 * <p>Held at three depths, because one alone would pass while the defect stood. The identity is
 * where it goes wrong; the elaboration is what stops working; the diagnostic is what an author sees.
