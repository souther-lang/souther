/**
 * What one module's reading of a declaration's clauses states, clause by clause.
 *
 * <p>Built for holding two readings of one declaration against each other. The comparison is over
 * {@link TermMeaning} and not over the term, because what is being asked is whether the two say the
 * same thing — a term carries where it was written, and two readings of one declaration made in two
 * modules are made over trees the reader never edited.
 *
 * <p>Clause by clause, keyed by {@link Clause.Ref}. Two readings of a declaration reach its clauses
 * in the order the declaration writes them, but an include brings a clause in under a second name
 * and a comparison by position would pair the wrong two the first time a declaration spreads
 * another. The reference is what the declaration answers by, so it pairs what the declaration would
 * call one clause.
 *
 * <p>What stopped is carried beside what stated rather than dropped. A reading in which every clause
 * stopped agrees with another in which every clause stopped, so a comparison that saw only the
 * stated ones would come back green over two readings that read nothing.
