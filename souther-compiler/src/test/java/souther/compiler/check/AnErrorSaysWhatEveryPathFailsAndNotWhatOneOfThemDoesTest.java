/**
 * A clause one branch fails is not a clause the value fails.
 *
 * <p>A construction under a conditional is read once per branch, and the branches may fail different
 * clauses. Every path then violates the invariant — which is what E2010 is raised on, and it is
 * right to raise it — while no clause is one every path fails, and no value that can be built here
 * fails both. Saying of either clause that "the value being built is one this clause rejects" is
 * untrue of the value that comes down the other branch.
 *
 * <p>The two quantifications are not the same one, and combining the branches by taking the stronger
 * of what they found puts them together: what a verdict is decided by is whether every path refuses
 * the invariant, and what a clause may be said to be is whether every path refuses that clause.
