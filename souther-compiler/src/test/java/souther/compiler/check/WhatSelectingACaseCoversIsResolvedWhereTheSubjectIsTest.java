/**
 * What selecting a case covers, and where that is worked out.
 *
 * <p>A case is two facts of different phases. What tests and reads a value is the
 * {@link souther.compiler.types.CaseSelector}, which says all of itself wherever it is written and
 * is held to that by {@code ACaseIsNotHalfDecidedTest}. What selecting it <em>covers</em> is not
 * like that: a case that is a sum stands for the leaves under it, and which leaves those are is a
 * fact about the declarations this compile read. So the atoms are not a component of the selector —
 * they are what {@link CaseSpace} adds when it resolves one, and {@link ResolvedCase} is the pair.
 *
 * <p>Held here and not in {@code types} for that reason. An invariant that needs {@link Symbols} to
 * state was never an invariant of a selector.
