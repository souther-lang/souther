/**
 * What makes two clauses two, and one clause reached twice one.
 *
 * <p>A clause is identified by the declaration that wrote it and its place among that declaration's
 * own clauses. Not by its name, which a clause need not have; not by where it is written, which this
 * compile need not be able to quote; and not by the walk that reached it, which reaches one clause
 * once per branch above the construction.
 *
 * <p>The first of those is what the sets a judgment carries used to get wrong in the other
 * direction: they held names, so two clauses an author wrote without names were nothing at all
 * rather than two entries. Nothing downstream could tell that from one clause, or from none.
