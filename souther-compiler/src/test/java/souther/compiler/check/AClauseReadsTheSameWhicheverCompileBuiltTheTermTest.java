/**
 * A clause reads the same whichever compile built the term it states.
 *
 * <p>What a declaration states is published, and two readings of one clause written a line apart
 * are equal while holding terms that are neither the same object nor written at the same place. So
 * a reader handed either of them has to come to the same answer, or "equal" is a word about two
 * things a reader can tell apart.
 *
 * <p>Three things are held here at once, and the first two are what make the third worth asking:
 * the published readings are equal, the terms behind them are two objects written at two places,
 * and what a reading of the model comes to is the same either way.
 *
 * <p>Compared as readings and not as terms. Two compiles write the clause at two places, so the
 * terms differ where the reading does not — which is the whole of what {@link TermMeaning} is for,
 * and using it here is using the thing the boundary is built on.
 *
 * <p><b>Nothing known makes this red, and that is worth writing down.</b> It was written expecting
 * to catch a reader that works out which fields a clause reads by walking the term it was handed:
 * looking for the declaring module's bindings in a tree another reading built, finding none, and
 * concluding the clause reads no fields — from which follows that every field it needs is filled.
 * Made to do exactly that, this still passes. A binding is named by the declaration that wrote the
 * field and by a number among that declaration's fields, so two compiles of one source name it
 * alike and the walk finds what it is looking for. The discontinuity that reasoning turns on is
 * not there.
 *
 * <p>So this holds a property rather than guarding a defect: what a reader comes to is a function
 * of what it was told and not of which compile built it. What it would show is a reading below
 * this one letting the place a term was written at change what it concludes; a place published as
 * where to put a caret is not that, and is not compared here.
