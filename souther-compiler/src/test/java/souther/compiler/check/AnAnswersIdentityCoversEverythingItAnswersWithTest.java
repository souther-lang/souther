/**
 * A state a query answers with is a value, and its identity is everything it answers with.
 *
 * <p>The store decides whether anything downstream has to be asked again by comparing the answer it
 * recomputed against the one it held: equal means nothing changed, and nothing that read it is asked
 * again. So a state whose {@code equals} leaves out something a reader can get out of it is a state
 * the store cannot tell has changed — the reader keeps the old one, and nothing anywhere reports
 * that it did.
 *
 * <p>Written by hand, an identity is a copy of the field list, and a field added later is not in it.
 * That has happened twice: a settled module gained the recursions its clauses left standing, and a
 * prepared module gained the definitions minted for its rows, and both were added beside an identity
 * that went on comparing what it compared before. Neither is visible in a diff of the identity,
 * because the identity is what did not change.
 *
 * <p>So it is read off the compiled class rather than off the source: which fields a class has is
 * the class's own answer, and which of them {@code equals} reaches is what the method actually
 * does. Reaches, and not loads directly — an identity here is usually written of a projection, and
 * comparing what a state hands over as a tree covers everything that tree is built from. A field is
 * uncovered only where nothing {@code equals} reaches ever loads it.
 *
 * <p>Two kinds of field are not part of an identity and are named here rather than guessed at. A
 * {@code volatile} field is a worked-out answer kept beside the state — writing it changes nothing
 * anybody can observe, and it is derived from the fields that are covered. A field a record
 * declares is covered by the identity the record already has, so a record is not asked about at all.
