/**
 * What an application is declared to answer, and what says so.

 * <p>An application is the one expression whose type is not in it. Every other form either carries
 * its own answer or is a step to a value that does; this one is the callee's declaration applied to
 * what the arguments state, and a reading with no step for applying anything answered that nothing
 * states what a call is — which is not a fact about any declaration.
 *
 * <p>Two things are held here and they pull apart. What is applied decides where the answer is read

 * nothing about its answer, so reading one means reading its body at the parameter types this
 * application gives it. That is the expansion below done again, so the cost of doing it is held too:
