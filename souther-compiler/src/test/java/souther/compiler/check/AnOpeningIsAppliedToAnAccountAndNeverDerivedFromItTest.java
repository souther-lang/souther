/**
 * An account of the rules applies what a choice left open and never works it out.
 *
 * <p>What each component of a choice's account is allowed to depend on, said as laws rather than as
 * cases. An account holds two things that came from two places — what this reading did with the
 * clause, and what the settlement decided the choice does to that — and the whole of what keeps
 * them apart is that neither is reachable from the other. A rule that walked from one to the other
 * would be a second answer to a question something else has already answered, and the two would
 * agree only until one of them changed.
 *
 * <p><b>Which is the shape the defect had.</b> Told from the flag for a clause nothing read, the
 * answer that comes out is that a branch narrowing a position its neighbour narrows the same way
 * binds nothing there. The example that shows it is a model
 * ({@code WhetherAConstraintStillBindsIsReadOffWhatTheAlternativesLeaveTest}); what is here is the
 * rule the example is an instance of, so a derivation reintroduced by another road is caught by the
 * same test.
