/**
 * Which rules a world has is settled before a reading says how far into them it goes.
 *
 * <p>A reading asked what one conjunct was holding reads the declaration under a rule set the
 * author did not write, and the conjunct left out is not a rule of that world at all. How far a
 * reading descends is its own answer ({@link Descent}) — a conjunction one takes whole is a part to
 * it and two parts to the reading beside it — and neither answer is about which rules there are.
 *
 * <p>Asked the other way round, a world holds for the readings that descend and for no others: a
 * reading that takes a conjunction whole is handed the node with the conjunct still under it and
 * reads a rule its world does not have. Every reading of a declaration's connectives descends
 * today, so nothing a model can be written as shows it — which is why this is asked of the fold
 * itself, with a reading that stops where the ones in this compiler do not.
