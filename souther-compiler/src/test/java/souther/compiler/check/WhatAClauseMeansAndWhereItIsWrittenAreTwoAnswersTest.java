/**
 * What a construction was judged against, and where the clause it was judged against is written.
 *
 * <p>Two answers to two questions, and an edit that moves the clause without changing a word of it
 * moves one of them. What the judgment says is what the declaration states, which the edit leaves
 * alone; where a report sends a reader is where the text is now, which the edit decides.
 *
 * <p>They used to be one answer. A judgment held the clause with the place it is written at, so a
 * line inserted above the declaration made a judgment that was not the judgment before it — of the
 * same clause, stating the same thing, about the same construction. Every reader of a judgment was
 * a reader of where the clause is written, whether it pointed anywhere or not.
 *
 * <p>What this fixes is not a report this compiler gets wrong today. It is what a cut at the module
 * boundary would get wrong: a boundary that let a reading stand because the clauses still mean what
 * they meant would leave the judgment cached, and a judgment carrying a place is a report pointing
 * at where the clause used to be. Asked of the declaration instead, the place is worked out again
 * whether or not the judgment was.
