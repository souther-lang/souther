/**
 * What a position admits, and whether this compiler could say so, are the same for the same rules.
 *
 * <p>Two patterns whose meet is a large machine, beside a rule naming one string. What the three of
 * them leave is that one string, and it is settled by asking that string of the other two: each
 * pattern is still made — a pattern is a machine and asking it anything means having it — and the
 * product of the two is not.
 *
 * <p>Which is only true of a reading that has all three before it builds anything. Read as it goes,
 * the two patterns meet first wherever the author happened to write them first — a machine of some
 * ninety thousand states — and a compiler that would not build it reports the position as one it
 * could not work out. The same rules, written in another order, build six hundred states and stop.
 *
 * <p>So this is the same model six ways: the three rules in every order they can be written in. The
 * answer has to be the same, and so does what the reading says about itself. What is asserted is
 * both, because either alone would pass for a compiler that got the values right and the account of
 * them wrong.
 *
 * <p>Held with an ordinary allowance rather than a small one. The point is not that a large machine
 * is refused — that is {@code WhatOneAnswerIsAllowedIsSpentOnce} — but that no product of two
 * patterns is built at all, whichever way round the rules arrive.
