 * things, and every pair and every triple of them is written out here rather than picked. The cases
 * that were got wrong were the ones nobody thought to write down: two branches each leaving the
 * number no value came out as whichever was on the right, and a case like that is not found by
 * asking whether the cases somebody wrote hold.
