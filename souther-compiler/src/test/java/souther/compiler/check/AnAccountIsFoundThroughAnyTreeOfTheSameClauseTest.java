/**
 * One clause built twice is one clause, and what a reading made of a part of it is found either way.
 *
 * <p>A clause reaches a value through whatever tree the step that brought it there built. Those
 * trees are equal and are not the same objects — a substitution that changes nothing hands back
 * what it was given, and one that changes something builds afresh — so a reader that filed what it
 * made of a part under the node it read it at held an address that answered for exactly one of
 * them. Asked with the other, it found nothing, and nothing is how a part that constrained a
 * position reads when the walk asks what it constrained.
 *
 * <p>What is held instead is where in the clause the part is. The occurrences are handed out once,
 * by the one reading of the structure ({@link ClauseExpr}), and the structure is what the two trees
 * share — so the coordinate is the same coordinate in both, while the nodes are two.
 *
 * <p>The control is in the second test: the nodes at one coordinate are equal and are not the same
 * object, which is what an address made of them would have been telling apart.
