/**
 * What a product of two values is held to, where the path bounds the two.
 *
 * <p>A product of two values is outside the affine fragment, so the check names it an atom of its
 * own and the domain holds nothing about it — however much it holds about the factors. What is
 * asked here is the step from the one to the other: the atom is recorded against what it was
 * computed from, and a reader turning that into a bound reads the factors out of the domain it is
 * given.
 *
 * <p>The two halves are apart on purpose. What an atom was computed from is a fact about the
 * expression and is settled where the atom is named; what it lies between depends on what the path
 * assumed, and is answered against the domain the question is asked with. Recording a bound at
 * naming time would fix it under whichever reading named it first.
