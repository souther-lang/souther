 * How many alternatives a clause would come to, counted before any of them is built.

 * <p>A budget has to be measurable before the work it limits. The number of alternatives a clause
 * comes to once duplicates are gone is not: finding it out is the expansion this is asked to bound.
 * So what is counted is the syntax — a choice adds, a conjunction multiplies, and a denial swaps the
 * two.
 *
 * <p><b>Counted on the fold that does the reading.</b> Which shapes are connectives, where a denial
 * goes and what is left as a leaf are {@link ClauseReading}'s. A walk of its own saying the same
 * thing again is a second answer that agrees with the first only until somebody changes one of
 * them — and the two coming apart is not a wrong count, it is a reading that expands past the
