 * <p>The helper builds a data, and an invariant that calls it is refused for reaching a construction.
 * Which module the helper is declared in is not part of that rule, so what the report says about it
 * must not turn on the move either — and it did: a helper of another module was treated as shipped
 * source and reported at the call, with the caret sized for a construction in a file the caret was
 * not in.
 *
 * <p>What the move may change is one thing only: whether this compile can show the reader the place.
 * A module compiled alongside is a file the reader holds; one read back off the module path is not,
