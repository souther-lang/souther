/**
 * Everywhere an operator can be, and what each of them wants one for.
 *
 * <p>Beside {@link AnOperatorIsAskedWhatItPlacesInOnePlaceTest}, which says how often an operator
 * may be read for what it places. That one holds the crossing from how a comparison is written to
 * what it means to one call; this one is the ground it stands on, so that an operator reaching
 * somewhere new is a line that has to be written down and given a reason. There is no crossing back:
 * what a comparison places is taken from a relation without an operator in between
 * ({@link ComparisonClaim#stating}), so a relation never becomes one.
 *
 * <p><b>And no line here is one a reader has because it holds a comparison.</b> Every reader below
 * a recognition once had the node it was recognised from, which is one call from the operator, and
 * what kept it out of this list was that nobody had made that call yet — a fact about the code and
 * not about the type. {@link souther.compiler.check.Comparison} holds no node now: what it carries
 * is what the operator placed and the two sides it placed it on, and which comparison a reader is
 * talking about is a name of its own. So a line arriving here for that reason is a reader that has
 * gone back to the tree, and that is what it would have to say.
 *
 * <p><b>One list, and the rule it comes from is the machine's.</b> A method that has an operator
 * names the type: to use a value as one, the type has to be established, and a symbolic reference
 * is how that is written down. Which instructions can carry one is a closed set the class file
 * format decides, and {@link #namesTheOperator} is held to that set by javac rather than by
 * anybody's memory of it. So what is here is every method whose code names the operator, together
 * with every method whose signature does and every field of that type — not a list of the ways
 * somebody thought of.
 *
 * <p><b>And nothing here works out what was done with it.</b> A switch, a constant compared
 * against, a set asked for membership and a map asked for an answer are four spellings of one act,
 * and a check that knew three of them would be a check somebody could write the fourth past. So
 * what is fixed is the having, and what each holder does with it is the reason written beside it.
 *
 * <p>Which puts the copiers in the list. A pass that rebuilds a tree meets every operator it walks
 * over and writes each one into the node it is making, and there is nothing to say about that
 * beyond saying it — a line reading "copies it into the node it is rebuilding" is a line anyone who
 * made it do more would have to edit.
 *
 * <p><b>What it does not see, said rather than left to be found.</b> An operator reached by name
 * through reflection is a string, and a string is not a reference to the type. And what is read is
 * this module's classes, so a reader of an operator compiled elsewhere is not here. Both are things
 * to be told about rather than things this can be widened to cover.
 *
 * <p><b>A list and not a count.</b> A number stays right while one line goes and another arrives,
 * and the arriving one is exactly what this is for.
