/**
 * What a term costs when it reads a named value twice.
 *
 * <p>What terms are made of is a graph and not a tree. A name read twice is one value read twice, and
 * {@code let (a, b) = t} reads {@code t} twice by itself, so a chain of those is a graph whose nodes
 * grow by one per link and whose paths double. A term holding each of its parts in full holds one
 * copy per path — twenty-four links once asked for more characters than an array can hold, when a
 * term was the string it was written out as.
 *
 * <p>Held on the size of the term rather than on the time a compile takes. Time is what the growth
 * showed up as last: the chain measured flat right up to the link that asked for two gigabytes at
 * once, because the walk is one lookup per name and only what it wrote doubled. What was wrong is the
 * size of the representation, so that is what is measured, and it is measured where it is built.
 *
 * <p>Written as bindings, since that is where the sharing is. A value is read twice by being named
 * and read twice, not by a tree holding one node twice — which is also why the walk stayed linear
 * while the writing did not.
