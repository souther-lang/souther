/**
 * What a choice leaves a position is composed once, and what leaves that reading is an observation.
 *
 * <p>The alternatives of a choice are readings of the whole value, so what one leaves a position is
 * settled where both of the languages that decide a branch's fate are held ({@link Confinement}).
 * A second composition of the same choice is a second answer about one model, and the two agree
 * only until somebody changes one of them — which is what this stops, on the one thing that leaves
 * that reading.
 *
 * <p><b>Said of the operations and not of their names.</b> Forbidding {@code join} and {@code
 * either} leaves the next algebra to be written under another name; what an algebra is, is an
 * operation over its own type, and there is none here. What may be asked of
 * {@link SettledOrderEnvelope} is where a position stops, and the answer to that is not another one
 * of these.
