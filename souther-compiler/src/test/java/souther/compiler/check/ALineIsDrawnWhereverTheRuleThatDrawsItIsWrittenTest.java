/**
 * A rule that draws a line draws it wherever the rule is written.
 *
 * <p>What a position admits and what a construction owes were the readings #1333 was about, and a
 * line is a third answer with a reader of its own: which authored rule placed which end
 * ({@link FieldDomains.Placed}) is what the declared bounds and the partition's lines are built
 * from. That reader classifies the clause it was handed, and a clause stating its rule through a
 * helper is that rule under a binding — so it reached no comparison and the declaration came back
 * with no line drawn on it, which is the difference the issue is written about.
 *
 * <p>Held on the lines themselves rather than on a verdict. A construction reads the rule through
 * one more reader, so the two spellings can come to one verdict while the lines under them differ.
 *
 * <p><b>The conjuncts stay the author's.</b> A binding is crossed and never split: which parts a
 * clause has is what its author wrote ({@link ClauseHelpers#conjunctsOf}, over the tree before any
 * expansion), so a helper whose body joins two rules is one conjunct and not two. What that leaves
 * is held below.
