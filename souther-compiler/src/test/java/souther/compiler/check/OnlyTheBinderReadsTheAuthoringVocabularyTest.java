/**
 * A fact about an operation is read against the library once, and everything below reads what that
 * made.
 *
 * <p>The declarations ({@link OperationFacts}) are written in an authoring vocabulary — a name for
 * the operation, a word for an argument ({@link ArgumentRef}) — that says nothing about whether the
 * library has such an operation or such an argument. {@link OperationFactBinder} holds every one of
 * them to the library and answers with {@link BoundOperationFact}s, in which every name has been
 * read against its declaration; a reader below it holds one of those and has nothing left to
 * resolve. What that arrangement can lose is a second reader of the authoring vocabulary: one that
 * takes the authored word and puts the binder's question again, by reading the declarations, or
 * the signature, or what {@link Combinators} says an operation hands its closure — and gets an
 * answer that agrees with the binder's for exactly as long as nobody changes either.
 *
 * <p>So the boundary is counted from what javac made of the module, on both sides. Above it, the
 * authoring vocabulary is named by its own package and by the binder and by nothing else, and the
 * declarations are read by the binder alone. Across it, each of the three steps from an authored
 * fact to a fact a reader holds is taken by the binder alone: a bound argument, a bound fact, and
 * the gathering of them are each minted nowhere else — since a bound fact a reader wrote for itself
 * would say a fact was held to the library where nothing held it, and would read no authoring
 * vocabulary for the census above to see. Below it, no arm of a bound fact carries an authored name
 * or word, and the readers of what an operation hands its closure are each written down with what
 * they want it for — since a reader that wanted it to find a fact's argument would be the binder's
 * question asked again.
 *
 * <p>Each set is compared whole rather than counted. A count lets one name be dropped and another
 * added and says nothing about it, which is exactly the edit this is here to catch.
