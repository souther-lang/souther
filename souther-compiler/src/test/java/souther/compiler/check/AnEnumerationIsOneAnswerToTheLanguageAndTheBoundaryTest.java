/**
 * A named sum the language calls an enumeration is one the boundary writes as a bare tag, and the
 * two are asked of different places.
 *
 * <p>{@link TypeOps#isUnitOnlySum} answers a question about the language — a type whose values can
 * be written out ({@link ValueUniverse}) and whose declaration orders them ({@code TypeOps
 * .orderingEnumeration}). {@link Boundary} answers a question about how a value crosses. They are
 * kept apart on purpose: folding them would make one answer decide both, and the day either moved
 * the other would move with it unasked.
 *
 * <p>Kept apart, they walk the atoms twice, so this holds the relation the spec states between them
 * (spec §sum-discrimination): a unit-only sum crosses as its case's name. It is not a test that two
 * implementations agree — it is the rule that lets them be two. Breaking it deliberately means
 * saying, here, that a sum can be an enumeration in the language and a discriminated object on the
 * wire.
