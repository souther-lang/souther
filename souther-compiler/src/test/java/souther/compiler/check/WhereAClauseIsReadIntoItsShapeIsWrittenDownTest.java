/**
 * Who reads a clause's tree into its shape, and where such a reading may happen.
 *
 * <p>What a clause is written out of — a conjunction, a choice, a denial — is read out of the tree
 * once ({@link ClauseExpr}), and everything downstream is an evaluator over what that left. A reader
 * that starts a second one is deciding for itself what the author wrote, and it decides it under a
 * polarity of its own: read afresh from a node, a clause the walk was holding as denied comes back
 * stated, and the occurrences under it are numbered from wherever the node begins rather than from
 * the clause.
 *
 * <p>Which is what a reading of ends did. It held the shape, went back to the node it was spelled
 * as, and asked for the shape again with the polarity written in as {@code true} — so a conjunction
 * an author wrote as a denied choice was a choice to that second reading, and the answer it filed
 * was about a clause nobody wrote.
 *
 * <p>Read off the compiled classes, and by the type the call is made with rather than by the name
 * alone: the reading that walks a clause into its shape calls itself, and a licence keyed by the
 * name would licence the entry point and the recursion together, so a caller reaching for the entry
 * point could take the recursion's place in the table and pass.
