/**
 * A choice reads the rule and not the tree it is written as.
 *
 * <p>{@code (a || b) || c} and {@code a || (b || c)} are one rule, so what a report says of them is
 * one thing. That is a property of the composition rather than of any one clause, which is why it is
 * held here and not by a pair of models: a rule whose alternatives happen to be settled by some
 * third reading would pass either way, and the property would go untested.
 *
 * <p>What it rests on is that a constraint and an answer are two things. A constraint is open to
 * being widened by an alternative nothing could read — a value satisfying that branch owes this one
 * nothing — and "this clause imposes nothing here", which is what a branch admitting nothing leaves,
 * is not: a further choice imposes nothing either. Held as one, whether the second survived turned
 * on where the brackets fell.
 *
 * <p><b>Every choice below is handed an opening of nothing, which is the opening it has.</b> No
 * branch here narrows a position, so there is no position a choice could be narrower without an
 * alternative, and that is so under either grouping. Where the alternatives do narrow something the
 * opening differs from one grouping to the next and is not a caller's to write down; that the two
 * groupings still come to one account is a fact about the whole walk and is held over sources
 * ({@code WhetherAConstraintStillBindsIsReadOffWhatTheAlternativesLeaveTest}).
