/**
 * A construction under guards that cannot all hold is not reported, whichever domain holds the
 * contradiction.
 *
 * <p>A guard reaches whatever domain has a word for what it says. A comparison reaches the numbers;
 * a predicate about a list reaches the facts and says nothing to the numbers. So the conditions on
 * a path can come to contradict in one domain while every other is untouched, and a reader asking
 * a single domain whether the path is reached walks it whenever it asked the domain that had never
 * heard of the guards. What it then reports is a violation on a path the program never takes.
 *
 * <p>Which domain is not something the author chose, so the programs below are the same program
 * twice with the contradiction moved. What made the difference visible is a clause that only the
 * numbers have a word for: a state at bottom proves everything, so a clause the contradicted domain
 * can read comes out discharged by that alone, and the two readings agree for a reason that has
 * nothing to do with the path. {@code List.length(value) >= 1} over a container built by
 * {@code List.append} is such a clause — no guard could be written about the built container, so it
 * is owed as a number and as nothing else.
