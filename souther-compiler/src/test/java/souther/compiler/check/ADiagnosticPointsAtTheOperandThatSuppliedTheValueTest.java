/**
 * A report about a value that did not fit points at the value, not at the form that asked for it.
 *
 * <p>The message names the operand in words — {@code argument 2 of String.append}, the text a
 * temporal was written as — and a reader who has the message still has to find the operand. Where
 * the caret sits under the form, that search crosses lines: an argument list has no bound on how far
 * its arguments are written from its callee, so the two can be a page apart. What the reader cannot
 * recover from the message is the operand, and that is what the caret is for.
 *
 * <p>The operand is the whole of what was written there, arguments and all. An argument that is
 * itself a call did not fit as the call it is, and a caret stopping at its callee's name leaves the
 * reader to work out that the rest of it is the same expression.
 *
 * <p>Which region a report gets is not decided by its code. The rows below cover the three paths a
 * call written in a body is typed by — a kernel applied against its declared signature, a helper
 * expanded, a behavior called by name — which answered three different ways for one code and one
 * kind of failure. They are the paths that exist now; a fourth is not held to anything here.
