/**
 * A construction the grammar takes apart is read without either caller being asked to name it.
 *
 * <p><b>Who owns a rule, and not whether two callers agree about it.</b> Two readers walk this
 * grammar with leaves of their own, and a rule one of them keeps is a rule the other is free not to
 * have: a newtype's construction was a number to the check that discharges a clause and an
 * expression nobody could read to the measure beside it, over the same construction and for no
 * reason the model states. A pair of fixtures showing the two now agreeing would say they agree
 * today; what says it cannot come apart again is that the reading needs no leaf at all.
 *
 * <p>So the leaf here fails when it is called. What is left composing the form is the grammar,
 * which is the thing being claimed to own these two eliminations — a construction of a newtype, and
 * a field read off a construction.
 *
 * <p>The values wrapped are written as arithmetic rather than as numbers. A number written out is a
 * constant of this grammar wherever it stands, and a carrier reads one through a newtype's
 * construction to find it, so a test over {@code Yen(100)} would pass with no rule for a
 * construction anywhere — and go on passing after the rule it is meant to hold was taken away.
