/**
 * A term may enter a reading. Nothing takes one back out.
 *
 * <p>{@link TermMeaning} is what a caller of a behavior depends on, and two of them are equal where
 * the terms they hold say the same thing — whatever the places on those terms are. That holds only
 * for as long as nothing hands the term over: two readings the store has called one answer would
 * then be two a reader can tell apart, which is the thing an answer is not allowed to be
 * ({@link souther.compiler.query.Db}).
 *
 * <p>So the asymmetry is what is checked, and not the absence of one accessor. A term goes in
 * through {@code of}; what comes out is another reading, or what the predicates made of one. Written
 * as "no method returns a {@code Core}", the check would pass the day someone writes
 * {@code void inspect(Consumer<Core>)} or {@code <T> T read(Function<Core, T>)} — a term handed out
 * through the parameter list rather than the answer. So what is written down is the operations there
 * are, and anything else is a line to be added here with what it is for.
 *
 * <p>Nothing here reads the field list for its own sake: a field nothing outside the class can reach
 * is not a way out. What is asked of the fields is only that none of them is reachable.
