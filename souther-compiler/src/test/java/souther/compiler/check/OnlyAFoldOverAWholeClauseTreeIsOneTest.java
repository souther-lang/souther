/**
 * Who may be an algebra over a whole clause tree.
 *
 * <p>{@link ClauseReading} is the algebra of the tree: what a leaf says, what a conjunction and a
 * choice of two readings come to, and the walk that carries the environment down and the answer up.
 * A reading that interprets only the leaves is not one of these, and typing it as one leaves it
 * owing the connectives — which is not an empty obligation, because a choice is not compositional
 * under either language on its own. Where an alternative is one nobody can take turns on what the
 * values and the ranges left together, so a choice settled inside one language drops the branch that
 * language could refuse and keeps the branch the other one did.
 *
 * <p>That is how the reading of ranges came to carry a second spelling of what a choice does. It
 * ran nowhere — the whole reading asks it for leaves — and it read as available, under a comment
 * stating the refuted rule as one in force.
 *
 * <p>Read off the compiled classes and not off the source, so an interface put between a reading and
 * this one arrives here as a row. Read from what this module compiled, so a fold a test builds to
 * look at the walk is not in the population: such a fold is an algebra of the whole tree and answers
 * for its own connectives, which is the thing this permits rather than the thing it refuses.
