/**
 * A term read for what it says, over every kind of term there is.
 *
 * <p>{@link TermMeaning} is a projection written a case per node kind, and a case is wrong in two
 * ways a compiler cannot see: it can read something that says where the node stands, and it can
 * leave out something the node says. The first makes a caller depend on an edit it cannot see; the
 * second makes two terms that say different things one dependency, which is the worse of the two —
 * a projection that read nothing at all would pass every test that only asks what it ignores.
 *
 * <p>So both are asked of each of the five things that say where a node stands: the position, the
 * occurrence a comparison or a fork is of the model, the copy of the body a fork stands in, and the
 * name and application a kept call was written as. Each is asked twice — moving it leaves the
 * reading alone, and moving what the node says does not.
 *
 * <p>Of fixtures, so that a build runs it. Every one of these is a pair of terms differing in one
 * thing, which is what a mutation of the projection has to be caught by; asking it of a corpus
 * instead would only reach the things two compilations of one model can be made to differ in, and
 * moving every line of a file reaches the positions and no ordinal. What a corpus does answer —
 * which kinds of term anything writes at all — is
 * {@code EveryKindOfTermACorpusWritesIsReadForWhatItSaysTest}.
