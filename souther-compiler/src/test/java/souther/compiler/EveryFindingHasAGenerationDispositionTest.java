/**
 * Every finding gets one generation disposition, and which bar a build asked for is no part of it.
 *
 * <p>A generator that offers rows for the findings it has a strategy for and says nothing about the
 * rest reads as though the block filled everything. An author who takes every row it offers is left
 * with a model that still fails, and nothing told them which part of the shortfall was never
 * attempted.
 *
 * <p>So the answer is total over the findings — <em>all</em> of them. It used to be total over the
 * ones a build refuses over, which is the coupling this holds against: what a bar refuses and what
 * a search can compose are two projections of one set of findings, and the first was standing in
 * the doorway of the second. A finding no bar had been asked for went unanswered, and no strategy
 * could be written for one until some bar gated on it first.
 *
 * <p>Which of the four it is depends on whether a strategy applies, not on what a search happened
 * to do: a strategy that recognised the finding and composed nothing is not the same as no strategy
 * for it at all, and neither is the same as a finding no row would answer.
 *
 * <p><b>Beside the exhaustive switch and not instead of it.</b> The compiler makes somebody answer
 * for a new shape of finding; this makes sure nothing filters one out before the switch is reached.
 * That is exactly what went wrong — a class no row is in was listed in the switch and dropped by
 * the line above it.
