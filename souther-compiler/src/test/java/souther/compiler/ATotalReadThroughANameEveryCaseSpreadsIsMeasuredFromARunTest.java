/**
 * A total whose values are read through a name every case of a sum spreads is measured from a run of
 * them.
 *
 * <p>The cases of the sum spread the field the total adds up, so the term's path names a position of
 * the sum and no case of it. That spelling is what the reading gives it and it is right — the rule
 * is about the shared name — and what has to hold is that the values a run walks are gathered under
 * the same name the term stands at, wherever the value at each occurrence turns out to be a case.
 *
 * <p>It did not. The walk over a row's values asked where a value is <em>written</em>, which at that
 * name is nowhere, so every point of the line came back undecided with two sentences: that the walk
 * reached no value there to read, and that nothing composed a row seen reaching it. The row standing
 * exactly on the point was in the file the whole time.
 *
 * <p><b>Two models and the same answer.</b> One spreads the amount through the cases and one puts it
 * on the element, and they owe the same points and meet the same ones. Held as a count alone, both
 * could go wrong together and agree about it; held as the points themselves, what each owes is
 * checked before the two are compared.
