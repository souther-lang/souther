/**
 * What a build that asked for no measurement is told.
 *
 * <p>{@code off} used to be a word the callers acted on and the measures did not: nobody built a
 * report at that setting, so every measure went ahead and counted, and a caller that did build one
 * got numbers from a run that had asked for none. Which of those two a reader met was decided by
 * which entry point they came through, and that is not something a level should decide (issue #955).
 *
 * <p>So it is a state of each measure, and of each measure's parts. The model's own answers stay —
 * which cases a signature has, which classes a position divides into, which lines its rules draw —
 * because no measurement made them true and none is needed to read them back.
