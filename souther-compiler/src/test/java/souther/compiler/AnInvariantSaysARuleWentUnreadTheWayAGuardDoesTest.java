/**
 * The same rule, written as an {@code invariant} and as a {@code guard}, reported the same way.
 *
 * <p>ADR-0090's promise: a rule this could not read is named, whichever rule it was. The two
 * behaviors below compare the same arithmetic form over two positions — one in a declaration, one
 * in a body — and a reader is owed the same sentence about both.
 *
 * <p>Issue #868. The {@code invariant}'s half was silent, and what silenced it was that its fields
 * carry a bound of their own: the account was kept as what a position was left with if nothing
 * divided it, so a line read from one rule answered for the rule beside it. A reader was left with
 * a model whose only stated rule about {@code length} looked like the one on {@code Cm}.
