/**
 * What a build is told about what its {@code example}s do not cover.
 *
 * <p>Off by default and one dial, because the levels differ in what they cost. Reading what the rows
 * already established is free; finding out which arms they went through means generating a second set
 * of classes and running every row again, and a build that did not ask for that must not pay for it —
 * an editor recompiles on every keystroke.
 *
 * <p>Which findings a level carries is every measure's own answer and not a list kept here. A line a
 * fork drew is met by getting the comparison to answer, so nothing can say whether a row met it
 * until the rows are instrumented; a line an invariant drew is met by writing the value, so it is
 * measured wherever the rows ran. The two are told apart by the measure and arrive at the level that
 * can make them (issue #955).
