/**
 * Where a reference is held, it is held as narrowly as what holds it means.
 *
 * <p>{@link ReachName} covers every route a name in a body takes, and only three of them reach a
 * declaration ({@link ReachName.Declaration}). Most things that carry a reference carry one of
 * those — a definition a module took on, a table of what a call expands to, what an expansion left
 * standing — and where such a carrier takes the wider type, the reference it is handed can be one
 * that reaches no declaration at all. What follows is a check inside the carrier, or a lookup that
 * quietly finds nothing.
 *
 * <p>Read off the compiled classes rather than the sources, and asserted as a list, because a list
 * is what makes a new one a decision. A position added to it is somebody saying that this one
 * genuinely takes any route — which is true of a body's own names and of the one place a route is
 * worked out, and is worth writing down when it is claimed.
 *
 * <p>Written after three rounds of review found the same shape three times, each in a place the
 * previous round's acceptance did not reach. What none of those rounds had was anything that says
 * where the frontier is; this does, so the next one is a failing test rather than a reading.
