/**
 * An edge nothing has shown to be writable says what was tried, not only that nothing was.
 *
 * <p>A line the rules draw is not counted until a concrete value is accepted at it, and a search
 * that composed nothing settles nothing either way. That is the semantics, and read off the report
 * alone it looks like an accident: the same four lines are counted in one model and not in another
 * that differs by a constraint on a field they have nothing to do with.
 *
 * <p>What separates the two is which facts the compiler managed to establish, and it is the one
 * thing the line does not say. An author who cannot see that reads it as the tool being unreliable
 * rather than as the tool being honest about what it could not prove.
