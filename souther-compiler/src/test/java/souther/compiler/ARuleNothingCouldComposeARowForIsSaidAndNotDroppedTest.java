/**
 * A rule of a decision this compiler could not compose a row for is said, in its own words.
 *
 * <p>Three axes and the states of one may not be written into another. Whether a row is owed at a
 * rule is what a search settles; whether one was composed for it is what this compiler managed. A
 * rule the search left unsettled is neither covered nor a gap — it is owed no row and no author is
 * asked for one — and that is exactly why it has to be said: a count of the body's rules with
 * nothing under some of them is a difference a reader can do nothing with, and a document answering
 * {@code taken: false} and nothing beside it reads as a gap.
 *
 * <p>The model is a body that reads one dependency at two calls and decides on both answers. One of
 * its ways needs the dependency to answer differently at each, which is a table written once for a
 * module rather than a line on a row, and nothing here writes one. So that way's rule goes
 * unsettled while its neighbours are settled, which is what makes the sentence about this rule
 * rather than about the behavior.
