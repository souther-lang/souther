/**
 * {@code T(v)} at a newtype is written as an application and means a construction, and the node that
 * replaces the application answers what the application answered.
 *
 * <p>Where a construction came from is settled when its source is read, and a desugaring is not a
 * reading — it changes which form says the same thing. So the application is what the transition
 * takes: an application carried into a body by a value that body named means a construction carried
 * the same way, and a pass turning one into the other has nothing of its own to say about it.
 *
 * <p>Asked of the transition rather than of a compile, because the answer is not observable in one:
 * the desugaring runs where every application it rewrites is still the body's own. What that costs
 * is that nothing would report the day it stops being true, which is what this is.
 *
 * <p>What is applied does not enter the question, so a literal stands there.
