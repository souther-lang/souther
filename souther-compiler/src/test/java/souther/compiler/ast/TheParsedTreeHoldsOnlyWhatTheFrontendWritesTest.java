/**
 * {@link Ast} is what the frontend answers with, so every form in it is one the frontend writes.
 *
 * <p>The parsed tree is not the tree below it with the resolution taken out. A form that comes into
 * being after resolution — a codec, which is derived from a data's shape, an expansion, which the
 * inliner writes — belongs to the representation whose pass makes it. Where such a form has a twin
 * here, nothing ever builds the twin, and every rule the reachable frontend is held to is applied
 * to a vocabulary that means nothing: an exhaustive translation is written for kinds no parse
 * answers with, and a reader takes the forms for something the language can be written in.
 *
 * <p>This asks less than that rule says, on purpose. What it measures is that the frontend's
 * compiled classes name the form somewhere — not that one of them builds it. Proving production
 * would mean following constructors through the factories {@code Ast} keeps for its own forms, and
 * the check would then be a harder thing to read than what it checks. A form the frontend names
 * without ever building would pass here; the rule is stated in {@code Ast}, and this is the cheap
 * way to find out that it has been broken.
 *
 * <p>The population is read off {@code Ast}'s nest members, so a form added tomorrow is in it the
 * day it is written. Only the concrete ones: an interface has no values of its own, and one whose
 * arms are all gone goes with them. Names are matched whole — {@code Ast$Bind} is not
 * {@code Ast$Binder}, and a check that let one stand for the other would report neither.
