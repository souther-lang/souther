/**
 * As {@link Hir.Name} for a type, so for a name used as a value: answered, or read and found to name
 * nothing.
 *
 * <p>The second was a denotation like any other — {@code ValueName.Unresolved}, carrying the
 * spelling — so a reader below the pass held a name that said it had been resolved and named
 * nothing. Every walk over a body had to know that: the switch over what a name denotes carried an
 * arm for it that answered null, 0 or false, and a walk that forgot the arm would not have compiled
 * but a walk that wrote it wrongly would.
 *
 * <p>It is a state of the reference now, not a kind of denotation, so a walk asks which of the two
 * it has and the one that names nothing has neither answer to give.
 *
 * <p>There were three. The third — read by nobody — was a state of the same type, which made "has
 * this been looked at" and "did it name something" two readings of one value. It is
 * {@link Ast.Var} now: a different representation, on the other side of {@code Resolve}, and not
 * something a reader here can be handed.
