/**
 * What {@code witness} promises is that nothing is instrumented and no row runs a second time.
 *
 * <p>Held as a structure and not as a clock. A stopwatch says a run got slower and never says what
 * it got slower doing, so a level that quietly started generating a second set of classes would
 * pass it on a fast enough host. What the level promises is that one key is never asked, and the
 * database records which keys were answered.
 *
 * <p>The measures themselves are asked at this level — a line an invariant drew is measured wherever
 * the rows ran (issue #955) — so the report below is the whole of what a {@code witness} run
 * produces, findings and verdict together. That is the run this holds to the promise.
