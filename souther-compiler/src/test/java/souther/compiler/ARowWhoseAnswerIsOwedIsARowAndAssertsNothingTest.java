 * <p>Two claims, and neither holds without the other. It is a row — the module compiles with it in,
 * so a block of them can be pasted whole and answered one at a time, and everything that keeps
 * source keeps these. And it asserts nothing — nothing it did is evidence that the model answers as
 * it should, so the work it stands for goes on being reported until somebody writes the answer.
 *
 * <p>The second is the one that is easy to lose. A row that ran and was counted as covering the arm
 * it went through would take a finding off the report and leave no assertion behind it, which is the
