/**
 * What a declaration's rules say about a position is settled by the declaration, not by the module
 * that asks (spec §invariant-discharge-representation).
 *
 * <p>A clause naming anything else its module defines — a {@code let} whose value it composes into
 * a pattern, a helper it calls — used to be read from whatever tree the asking module happened to
 * hold. The declaring module held the expanded one and every importer held the written one, so one
 * declaration said two things about the values it admits and which a reader got depended on who
 * was asking. A report comparing two modules had no way to tell that from the declarations
 * differing.
 *
 * <p><b>What is held here is agreement, not readability.</b> The two modules answer alike about
 * every declaration, and that is the whole claim. A clause whose expanded form this compiler cannot
 * take apart still cannot be taken apart — it is now unreadable from both, where it used to be
 * unread from one and unreadable from the other. Asking for it to become readable would be asking
 * this to close a second thing: how far a reading gets into an expanded helper is a limit of the
 * reading, and is not decided by where anyone was standing.
 *
 * <p>The literal clause is the control. Its written form and its expanded form are the same tree,
 * so it read alike from both modules before any of this and reads alike now; a run where it moved
 * would be a run where something other than the representation changed.
