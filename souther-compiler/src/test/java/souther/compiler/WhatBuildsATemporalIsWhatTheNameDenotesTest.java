/**
 * Which applications build a temporal, and which only answer one.
 *
 * <p>{@code Date("2026-01-01")} builds a date, and the checker settles that where it resolves the
 * name: the callee denotes the library namespace, which constructs. Nothing else does — a behavior a
 * model declares of its own named {@code Date} is a behavior, and a behavior answering a {@code Date}
 * over a written string is a behavior too, whatever it is spelled and whatever it answers.
 *
 * <p>Readers downstream of that used to decide it for themselves, and each took what was in reach:
 * the emitter compared the callee's spelling against the four temporals, and the readings that draw
 * lines read the type the call answered. So a model's own {@code Date} was compiled as
 * {@code LocalDate.parse} with its injected implementation never called, and a line was drawn at a
 * date wherever a behavior answering one was applied to a literal. What the source wrote is a value
 * of its own now, so none of them has anything left to decide.
