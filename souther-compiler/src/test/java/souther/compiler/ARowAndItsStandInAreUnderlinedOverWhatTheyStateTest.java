/**
 * A report about two statements that disagree underlines what each of them states.
 *
 * <p>The example machinery is the reader of an expression's extent that is not the type checker, and
 * it held the older form of the same mistake for longer: a position and a number of columns, laid
 * off from the position with {@code Region.ofWidth}. A region built that way ends on the line it
 * began on whatever it was measured from, so a row stating a construction written over several lines
 * was marked at its first character and the reader was left to find the rest of it.
 *
 * <p>The other half of that shape — a position that is not where the value begins — cannot arise
 * here: a fixture is a literal or a construction (E1908), and each of those is anchored where it
 * starts. So what is held below is the half that can.
