/**
 * A report about the value a function argument answered with underlines the expression that supplied
 * that value.
 *
 * <p>The value a block answers is its body's, and a block's own position is where its parameters
 * start. A report that names what the block returned and points at what takes its parameters has the
 * reader looking at one thing while being told about another — the two are on different lines as soon
 * as the block is written over more than one.
 *
 * <p>A {@code let} written above the answer holds the value it binds and not the block's answer, so
 * the bindings are stepped over. An {@code if} or a {@code match} is not: its type is the join of its
 * arms, so no one arm supplied it and the whole construct is what did.
 *
 * <p>Where the argument is a function value rather than a block, nothing at this call site made the
 * value — the expression that did is in the function's own declaration — so the argument is as far as
 * the source goes.
