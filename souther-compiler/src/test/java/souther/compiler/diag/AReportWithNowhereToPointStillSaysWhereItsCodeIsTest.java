/**
 * What a report with nowhere to point tells a reader, on every surface that shows it.
 *
 * <p>A citation tells five states apart and a diagnostic's primary now carries the one that has no
 * place and does know where the code is. Carrying it is only half: a value nothing reads is a value
 * nobody has, and the surfaces read the primary's <em>region</em> — which such a report has none of.
 * So the terminal said the sentence with no account of why there was no caret, and the JSON a build
 * reads said nothing at all.
 *
 * <p>Both of those are the drop this whole change is about, arriving at the last boundary: a fact the
 * compiler knows, thrown away, and reconstructed downstream from whatever is to hand.
