/**
 * A report about an expression underlines the expression, not a per-kind guess at how wide it is.
 *
 * <p>Where a node is anchored and how far it reaches are two questions. An anchor may sit anywhere
 * the node is best complained at — a binary operation at its operator, a field read at its field —
 * so a region built from the anchor and a measured width answers neither: it starts in the middle of
 * what was written and stops wherever the measurement happened to land.
 *
 * <p>The measurement is the second half of it. A width read off a decoded value is a claim about the
 * value and not about the file, and the two part company wherever the source spells something the
 * value does not keep: an escape, a decomposed spelling, a leading zero.
 *
 * <p>So every case here cuts the region out of the source and compares the characters. An assertion
 * on the number of columns would pass on a region of the right size in the wrong place.
