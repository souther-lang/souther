/**
 * Where a join is refused, the report is drawn at the operand it was refused at, and the type that
 * operand conflicts with is labelled only where a written operand has it.
 *
 * <p>Which of the two decides is where the type came from, not whether a region could be found for
 * it. A list literal and an {@code else}'s arms reach the join through an accumulator, and an
 * accumulator is the join of everything before it — so it is stated in words. That it happens to be
 * one operand's type when only one has been seen is a fact about the length of the input, and making
 * the report's shape turn on it would have {@code [1, "x", 2]} and {@code [1, 2, "x"]} reported two
 * different ways.
 *
 * <p>{@code ++} reaches the same join from two written operands, one level in from what it compares.
 * Both of them have their element type labelled, because both of them have one.
