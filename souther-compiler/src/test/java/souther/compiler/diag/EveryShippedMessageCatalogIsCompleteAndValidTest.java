/**
 * Every catalog that ships is complete on its own and valid on its own.
 *
 * <p>The checks here used to name the English and the Japanese catalog, one literal path each. A
 * third catalog therefore shipped with nothing said about it: a file of three keys quoting a
 * standard-library name that no longer exists passed every one of them, and a compile run in that
 * language answered with its message body translated and its title, its hint and every key it did
 * not define still in English. {@link ResourceBundle} falls back to the base for a key a locale is
 * missing, which is what turns an incomplete catalog into one answer written half in each language
 * rather than into a visible failure.
 *
 * <p>So the quantifier is over the catalog files that ship, discovered from the tree, and not over a
 * list of locales somebody has to remember to extend. A catalog added tomorrow is under all of this
 * the moment it is written.
 *
 * <p>The fallback stays: a key missing from both catalogs still renders as itself rather than
 * stopping a compile, and a bundle half-migrated on a branch still runs. What it no longer is, is
 * how a shipped catalog is allowed to be incomplete.
 *
 * <p>Validity is checked over every message rather than over the ones that name an argument, since
 * {@code Messages.get} renders them all as patterns. It is also checked over the file's physical
 * shape, because the checks that read a catalog line by line are only as good as the format they
 * assume {@link Properties} was given.
