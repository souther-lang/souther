/**
 * Where a report is said and where its repair writes come apart the moment the report is moved.
 *
 * <p>{@link Diagnostic#reachedFrom} is for a finding about code this compile has no source for: the
 * caret goes to the nearest place on the way to that module a file here writes, which is an
 * {@code import} line. The characters that answer the finding did not move — they are in the
 * module's own text, wherever that is — so the repair is what it was.
 *
 * <p>Read together with {@code Compilation.repairs}, which offers an edit in the file it writes
 * into: a repair left pointing at text nobody holds is offered nowhere, and one that followed the
 * caret would be offered on an import line, whose characters it says nothing about.
