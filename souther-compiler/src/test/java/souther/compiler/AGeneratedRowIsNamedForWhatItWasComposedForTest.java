/**
 * {@code --generate} writes rows, and a written row carries a name — so the generator is a producer
 * of names and is held to what a name is (<<a-row-name-is-unique-within-its-behavior>>).
 *
 * <p>Being distinct within one run is the smaller half. The half that decides the design is that a
 * row's name says which row it is rather than what this run of the generator happened to hand it: a
 * candidate is composed for a cell of the partition or for a line a rule draws, and it is named for
 * that. What it turns out to settle beside that is a fact about the run — a row written elsewhere can
 * meet a line this row also sits on, and the line stops being offered — and naming a row for it made
 * the name move when nothing about the row had.
 *
 * <p>That is what the second test here pins, and it pins the other direction too: the set a row
 * settles is allowed to change. The two are separate facts and only one of them is an identity.
