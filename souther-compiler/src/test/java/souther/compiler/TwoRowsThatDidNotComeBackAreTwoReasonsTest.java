/**
 * Two rows that did not come back are two things to go and look at.
 *
 * <p>A reason a measure could not read everything is kept one per identity — a module's classes
 * failing to be instrumented is one fact however many sources went looking for it — and a row that
 * did not come back used to be identified by the behavior it is written for. So a behavior with two
 * such rows left one reason, and the report said "a row of `take` did not come back" once whichever
 * of them a reader was owed.
 *
 * <p>The other half is the source. A row written with no name is numbered within the source it is
 * written in, so a behavior exampled in its module and in an attached file has a first row in each;
 * carried as the ordinal alone, those two are one identity in a set (issue #996).
