/**
 * Two rows answering the same thing are one piece of work.
 *
 * <p>A candidate is composed for one item and the positions that item does not name hold whatever
 * the row has to hold, so a row composed for one thing can stand where another asks. Nothing used to
 * put that question: rows were joined where their values were written the same way and nowhere else,
 * so a row inside a region and a row at the end of it went out as two.
 *
 * <p>The model here is the one the shipping rules are written from, with the three rows a person
 * writes first. What is left uncovered is a class at two of the regions, four arms, two points of
 * the comparison a guard draws and two of a declaration's own line — and the rows composed at the
 * declaration's line stand inside the comparison's regions, which is what takes two rows out.
 *
 * <p>What says five is enough is not the arithmetic above but the findings: every gap the report
 * raises is something this run is asked about, and one of the rows that are offered stands at it.
 * The issue counted six by hand, one of which was the only thing offering for a point a written row
 * already stands at — which is nobody's work.
