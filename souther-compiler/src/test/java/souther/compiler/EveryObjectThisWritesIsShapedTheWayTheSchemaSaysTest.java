/**
 * Every object this writes has the keys the shipped schema declares for it, and all of them.
 *
 * <p>The schema and the writer are two accounts of one document, and nothing made them agree except
 * somebody remembering to change both. What held them together was a check naming the objects it
 * looked at — {@code findings} and {@code partition.unanswered}, the two a single earlier defect
 * happened to touch. An object nobody had named was a place the two could disagree in silence, and
 * they did: issue #953 added {@code status} and {@code weakening} to ten objects and made four
 * fields conditional, and every document this compiler wrote was refused by the schema shipped
 * beside it for a year's worth of readers before anybody looked.
 *
 * <p><b>So this names nothing.</b> It walks the document and the schema together, from the root, and
 * reaches whatever the two of them reach. A key moved to another object is caught wherever it lands,
 * and an object added later is checked without being told about.
 *
 * <p><b>It is not a validator, and it refuses to look like one.</b> The walk is
 * {@link DocumentShape}, which fails on a keyword it does not understand rather than stepping over
 * it — a walk that skips what it does not know is a check that stops saying anything the moment the
 * schema grows, which is how the check it replaces came to pass over a document with twenty-seven
 * violations in it.
