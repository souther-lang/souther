/**
 * A point below what the values a total is taken over admit is excluded, and not undecided.
 *
 * <p>A guard at nought over a total of amounts declared at or above nought draws a border whose
 * outward point is below nought. Nothing the model admits stands there, and the report has the words
 * for exactly that — it says them of a bound on a position everywhere else. What it said of the
 * total was that it did not know: the point was owed, no row could be composed for it because none
 * exists, and the account carried a debt no rows a person writes could ever meet.
 *
 * <p>What was missing was that a total is answered by no position, and only a position published
 * where a number runs. Now the run answers for its own total, out of what every value it walks
 * guarantees and the step the operation repeats.
 *
 * <p>The point being excluded is the whole of the claim. The neighbouring points stay owed and stay
 * reported, which is what says the border is still being measured rather than dropped.
