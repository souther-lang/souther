/**
 * A question stands under the heading of the measure that answers it.
 *
 * <p>Two questions, two measures. Which values may stand at a position is what equivalence
 * partitions are made of; where the values stop is a border. #869 gave them separate headings and
 * separate counts, and a rule nothing accounted for is reported under one of them — a line printed
 * beside the classes sends an author looking for a class, two headings away from the border it is
 * about, which is the shape of issue #842.
 *
 * <p>Not read off the borders that came back either. The line below is exactly the one this compiler
 * could not fold, so there is no border to walk; that is when the question stands.
