/**
 * A body comparing a date draws a line, and the rows are owed both sides of it.
 *
 * <p>{@code Date} is one of the ordered primitives — {@code <} typechecks and the branch is real —
 * and the reading that draws lines was written for numbers, so a rule dividing an input by a date
 * came back as a position the model divides no way. Every business rule with a cutover date is this
 * one.
 *
 * <p>A date is a discrete total order, so what an interval and a neighbour need of it is what a whole
 * number gives: compare, and the value one step either way. Nothing about that is arithmetic on the
 * text, and nothing a row or a report shows may be the count that carries it — an author reads
 * {@code Date("2026-01-01")}, never a day number.
