/**
 * A representation keeps a call standing for the analysis that has rules about the operation. The
 * tree the backend emits from keeps none, so one reaching the emitter means it was handed another
 * tree — and that is decided by what the node is.
 *
 * <p>Not by what the call names. An emitter that refused only the operations it had no bytecode for
 * would emit the ones it happened to know, which is the same table lookup that let the two
 * representations be confused in the first place: {@code List.sortBy} has an emitter and
 * {@code List.map} does not, and neither of them belongs in a tree that runs.
