/**
 * The backend knows what a {@code Decimal} is represented by and does not decide what an operation
 * on one means (ADR-0112).
 *
 * <p>Those are two different things and only the second is refused here. {@code BigDecimal} is the
 * JVM form of a {@code Decimal}, so the backend builds a literal with it, names it in a descriptor
 * and casts to it, and a test asking that the name not appear would fail on a model that writes
 * {@code 1.5m}. What it may not do is perform a Souther operation with a {@code BigDecimal} method:
 * {@code a + b} emits a call to {@code DecimalMath.add}, as an {@code Int} {@code +} has always
 * emitted one to {@code IntMath.addExact}.
 *
 * <p>This is the rule that was not held. {@code +}, {@code -} and {@code *} went straight to
 * {@code BigDecimal}, whose sum, difference and product are all partial at the ends of the scale
 * range — so a scale overflow left a behavior as {@code java.lang.ArithmeticException}, from a
 * program that has no such type. {@code Decimal.divide} was written out in {@code BodyGen} and
 * narrowed its scale with a raw {@code l2i} (issue #976). Both are shapes this refuses structurally:
 * an operation written the old way stops the build rather than waiting to be noticed.
