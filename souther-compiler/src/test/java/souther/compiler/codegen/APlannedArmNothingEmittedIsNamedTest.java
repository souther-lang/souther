/**
 * Which of the arms a plan numbered never reached the bytecode.
 *
 * <p>The half of the numbering that nothing at the site can see. An emitter that walks a body
 * without counting its arms does not fail where it walks it — it writes a class that works, one
 * probe short, and every arm it left out is then reported as an arm no row goes through. An author
 * reads that as a gap in their model and goes looking for a row to write against a branch their rows
 * already take. So what was planned and what was emitted are compared once, at the end, and the
 * comparison is what this is about.
 *
 * <p>Asked of the context that holds both sides rather than of a generation. A generation reaches
 * this state only by an emitter forgetting to count, which is not something a caller can ask for —
 * so what a test can hold is that the comparison names exactly the arms nothing wrote.
