 * a rule that went unread may yet refuse it. The axis has carried that since it was measured, with
 * nothing reading it — so two classes were offered and neither surface said what they rested on.
 *
 * <p>Said apart from a position with no axis at all. Both are readings that did not finish, and
 * they are not the same thing to act on: reading the same sentence about a position with three
 * classes as about one with none says the numbers beside it are not to be believed.
