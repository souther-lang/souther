/**
 * A line the body draws is the model's line wherever in the condition it is written.
 *
 * <p>Two behaviors comparing the same position to the same number. One writes the comparison on its
 * own and gets an axis divided at it and a boundary on each side; the other writes a second
 * comparison in front of it and used to get neither. Nothing about the model differs, so nothing
 * about what the rows owe should.
 *
 * <p>Both sides of the line are owed, including the one a row reaches by making the comparison false.
 * Under {@code A && B} that row lands in {@code else}, where a row that never got to {@code B} lands
 * too — so the arms do not decide it and the comparison is observed where it runs instead.
