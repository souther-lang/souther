/**
 * A label carries where it is, and no reader works that out from where the label ended up.
 *
 * <p>The two used to be the same thing. A label naming no source was read in whichever file the
 * diagnostic was filed under, which is right for a position somebody made by hand and wrong for one
 * read out of a text this compile has no file for — and from the null alone nothing could tell them
 * apart. So a label about a clause of a published module was a sentence about a line of the file the
 * caller was compiling, and the three readers that noticed dropped it instead of saying it.
 *
 * <p>Measured on the same rule reported against the same construction, once with the declaration in
 * this compile and once with it off the module path. Which of the two the reader gets is the only
 * difference, and what changes between them is what this is about.
