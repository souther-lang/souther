/**
 * An obligation nothing settled is uncertain however many places it was counted at.
 *
 * <p>What an unsettled rule leaves undecided is how many rules the obligation stands for, and one
 * place can stand for several: a rule chosen while the behavior runs arrives at one call site, and
 * the arms one of them takes say nothing about the arms another would. Asked as "were several
 * places put together", such a place came back settled — its arms were judged as though one rule
 * had been through them, and the count called itself complete over two.
 *
 * <p>Built here rather than compiled from a model. A model whose rule is chosen while it runs is
 * written in this language and is the case this is about, but its rows cannot be read at all -- the
 * arms come back unavailable, so nothing downstream of them is reached. What this holds is the rule
 * the reading follows on the day they can be, and
 * {@code ARuleChosenWhileItRunsIsNeverACompleteMeasureTest} holds the end of it that a model can
 * reach today.
