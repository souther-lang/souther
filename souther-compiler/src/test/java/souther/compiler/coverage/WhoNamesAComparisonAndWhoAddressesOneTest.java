/**
 * Where a run through a comparison is written down is handed out by one place.
 *
 * <p><b>Two questions, and only one of them is answered by handing something out.</b> Which
 * comparison a reading is talking about is the {@link souther.compiler.types.ConstructOccurrence}
 * the tree carries, so there is nothing to hand out and no second place that could; what has a
 * {@link ComparisonEmissionSite} is what the plan instruments, which is fewer — a comparison behind
 * an abort is one no run reaches. Held as one value the two were the same number, so a reading
 * asking which comparison it was looking at got an answer that was true only while every comparison
 * the catalog held had been numbered.
 *
 * <p>Which makes who may make an address the thing to hold. A second place handing one out is a
 * number the emitter never wrote, and a claim about a run that no run can satisfy.
 *
 * <p>Read off the compiled classes, so what is counted is what a method does rather than what a
 * reading of the sources makes of it — a call written inside a lambda belongs to the lambda, and
 * this says so. A constructor handed over rather than called belongs to the method that hands it
 * over, which is where the {@code invokedynamic} carrying it stands.
 *
 * <p><b>What it does not see, said rather than left to be found.</b> The tests are not in
 * {@code target/classes}: a fixture that writes a report about a comparison nothing compiled makes
 * one of these by hand, and that is a fixture standing in for a catalog rather than a second answer
 * inside the compiler. And what is read is this module's classes — a maker written in the CLI or
 * the language server would not be counted here. Widening it is not free: those modules are built
 * after this one, so a walk over their output would read whatever the last build left and would say
 * nothing at all on a clean one. Both are things to be told about rather than things this can be
 * widened to cover.
