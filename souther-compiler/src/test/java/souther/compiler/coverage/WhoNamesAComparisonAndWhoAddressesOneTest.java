/**
 * Which comparison a reading is talking about, and where a run through one is written down, are
 * handed out by one place each.
 *
 * <p><b>Two names for two questions, and the answer to each has an owner.</b> Every comparison of
 * every body has a {@link ComparisonOccurrence}; what has a {@link ComparisonEmissionSite} is what
 * the plan instruments, which is fewer — a comparison behind an abort is one no run reaches. Held
 * as one value the two were the same number, so a reading asking which comparison it was looking at
 * got an answer that was true only while every comparison the catalog held had been numbered.
 *
 * <p>Which makes who may make one the thing to hold. A second place handing out occurrences is a
 * second naming, and two readers agreeing about which comparison they mean would come back down to
 * their having been given the same pair. A second place handing out addresses is a number the
 * emitter never wrote, and a claim about a run that no run can satisfy.
 *
 * <p>Read off the compiled classes, so what is counted is what a method does rather than what a
 * reading of the sources makes of it — a call written inside a lambda belongs to the lambda, and
 * this says so.
 *
 * <p><b>What it does not see, said rather than left to be found.</b> The tests are not in
 * {@code target/classes}: a fixture that writes a report about a comparison nothing compiled makes
 * one of these by hand, and that is a fixture standing in for a catalog rather than a second answer
 * inside the compiler. And what is read is this module's classes — a maker written in the CLI or
 * the language server would not be counted here. Widening it is not free: those modules are built
 * after this one, so a walk over their output would read whatever the last build left and would say
 * nothing at all on a clean one. Both are things to be told about rather than things this can be
 * widened to cover.
