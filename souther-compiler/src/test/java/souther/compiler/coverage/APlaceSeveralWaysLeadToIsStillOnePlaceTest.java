/**
 * A node several ways lead to is one place, bound once, and numbered once.
 *
 * <p>A body is a tree to read and a graph to walk. Nothing a source writes makes one node stand in
 * two slots, but a pass that rewrote two equal subtrees into one leaves exactly that, and the
 * corpora hold such a place. What that place must not become is two: two names for one binder, or
 * two numbers for one arm — the second of which the emitter lights on no run and every count reads
 * as a place nothing reaches.
 *
 * <p>The trees here are built rather than compiled, because no source this compiler accepts makes
 * one. They are what a pass would leave, and they are handed to the numbering as bodies.
