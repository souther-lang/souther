/**
 * A comparison the author wrote once is watched wherever the operation evaluates it.
 *
 * <p>{@code List.distinctBy} asks its key twice — once to see whether the key was already met and
 * once to record it — so a comparison written inside the key is written into the tree that runs
 * twice. The model states one rule all the same: which of the two applications ran is the
 * operation's business, and the author wrote one comparison.
 *
 * <p><b>Written for the shape rather than found in a corpus.</b> The crossing from what a model
 * states to where a run through it is written down was built holding one place per construct, and
 * the measurement that said so walked the models this work happened to have. None of them called an
 * operation that evaluates a closure twice, so the first model that did stopped the compile. What
 * the library does is read off the library, and this holds the crossing to it.
 *
 * <p>Three ways of breaking it and one test. Refusing the second materialisation fails, because the
 * join comes back with two; keeping only the last fails, for the same reason; and telling the two
 * apart by where inside the operation they stand fails, because the model would then state two
 * rules where the author wrote one.
