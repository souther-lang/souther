/**
 * What a test asks of a plan that the package keeps to itself.
 *
 * <p>Two kinds of thing, and both are here for the same reason: a plan is made where the bodies
 * are walked, and what it holds is not handed out. A test driving a reader into a state no source
 * reaches still has to hand it a plan, and a test counting what a plan numbered has to see the
 * nodes — neither of which a caller outside this package can do.
 *
 * <p>Assembled here and not asked of the plan. A derived plan is wanted by tests and by nothing
 * this compiler does, so the operation making one belongs where its callers are: written on the
 * plan it would stand in the list of what may put a plan together, under a reason that is about a
 * test — which is not what that list is for.
