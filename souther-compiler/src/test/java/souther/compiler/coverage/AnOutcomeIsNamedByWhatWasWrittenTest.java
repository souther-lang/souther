/**
 * What a coverage report calls a construct, and what it calls one way through it.
 *
 * <p>Three constructs of the language become one {@code if} before anything runs — an {@code if}, a
 * {@code guard}, and a comprehension's condition — and the tree that runs is where the report used
 * to read the answer off. It named all three {@code guard}, and named the ways through them
 * {@code then} and {@code else} however the source wrote them, so two of every three readers were
 * sent looking for a form that is not in the file.
 *
 * <p>Held as the pair, because that is where the meaning is. The construct comes from the origin the
 * fork carries, the way through it is a {@link SourceOutcome}, and neither says the other.
