/**
 * A place is asked for its number where a number is what has to be written, and nowhere else.
 *
 * <p>The whole of the typed vocabulary rests on the number being a thing a caller cannot get hold
 * of. A number is a place only under the numbering that handed it out, so a caller holding a bare
 * {@code int} can pair it with anything — another plan's site, another family's, one nothing
 * issued — and no later check can tell what it did from a right answer. That is the defect this
 * numbering exists to close, and it comes back the moment a reader takes the number out.
 *
 * <p>What is left is the one place a number is the answer: the call the emitter writes into a
 * probed class. A probed class is handed an {@code int} because that is what {@code invokestatic}
 * carries, and it has no numbering to ask anything of — so the emitter turns the place back into a
 * number, and the check beside it that says every place the plan named was written is asking the
 * same question in the same words.
 *
 * <p><b>Held here rather than said in a comment.</b> {@link RunSite#raw()} says it is the one way
 * out of the typed vocabulary; a sentence saying so is true of the code that was there when it was
 * written, and the next reader that wants a number has nothing to stop it. What stops it is this.
 *
 * <p>Read off the compiled classes, so what is counted is what a method does rather than what a
 * reading of the sources makes of it — a call written inside a lambda belongs to the lambda, and
 * this says so.
 *
 * <p><b>What it does not see, said rather than left to be found.</b> The tests are not in
 * {@code target/classes}: a fixture comparing what two numberings made of one number is standing in
 * for a reader that has both, which is not something inside the compiler. And what is read is this
 * module's classes — a reader written in the CLI or the language server would not be counted here.
 * Both are things to be told about rather than things this can be widened to cover.
