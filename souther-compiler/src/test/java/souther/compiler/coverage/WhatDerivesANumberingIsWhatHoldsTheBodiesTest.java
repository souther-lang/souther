/**
 * A module's numbering is derived where its bodies are held, and nowhere else in the compiler.
 *
 * <p>{@link CoverageSites#of} is a function of the bodies, so two calls of it over one module come
 * to one numbering. That is what a reader takes on trust when it derives its own: the emitter wrote
 * numbers into probe calls under one plan, and a measure looks a hit up under another, and the two
 * are about one place only while the walk keeps agreeing with itself. Which is a property to hold
 * rather than a thing to rely on quietly — and the fewer places derive one, the less of the
 * compiler that property has to hold across.
 *
 * <p>So what is fixed here is not that the numbering is right; it is who may ask for one. A reader
 * that wants to know what a hit set means asks the check that holds the bodies, and there is one
 * such check per module. A second derivation somewhere else is a second answer that no later check
 * could tell from the first, since both are true of the same bodies until one of them stops being.
 *
 * <p><b>Who derives one, not who has one.</b> A method that asks the check for the module's
 * numbering is not counted here and is not meant to be: it takes the answer the bodies' own holder
 * gives, which is the whole of what this fixes. So a second way of <em>reaching</em> that answer —
 * a helper elsewhere that asks the check and hands the plan on — stays green under this. What is
 * wrong with such a helper is that a reader then has two routes to one answer, not that the two
 * could disagree.
 *
 * <p>Read off the compiled classes, so what is counted is what a method does rather than what a
 * reading of the sources makes of it — a call written inside a lambda belongs to the lambda, and
 * this says so.
 *
 * <p><b>What it does not see, said rather than left to be found.</b> The tests are not in
 * {@code target/classes}: a test deriving a plan straight from bodies is a fixture standing in for
 * a compile, and there is no reader downstream of it to disagree with. And what is read is this
 * module's classes — a caller written in the CLI or the language server would not be counted here.
 * Widening it is not free: those modules are built after this one, so a walk over their output
 * would read whatever the last build left and would say nothing at all on a clean one.
