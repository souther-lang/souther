/**
 * A module's places are walked once, by the answer that holds its bodies.
 *
 * <p>A plan is filed by which {@link souther.compiler.core.Core} objects were put in it. Two checks
 * of one source build trees a record compares as equal, so a plan of one and a plan of the other
 * hold everything alike and answer for different objects — and a reader handed the wrong one gets
 * nothing back from every lookup, which is indistinguishable from a place that was never numbered.
 * So there is one plan of a module, kept by the check that walked the bodies for it, and everything
 * else is handed that one.
 *
 * <p><b>Both doors, because either alone leaves the other open.</b> The walk is one way in and the
 * constructor is the other: a caller assembling a plan out of another plan's parts never calls the
 * walk, and a caller walking the bodies a second time never calls the constructor. Each is counted
 * rather than merely looked for, because a second walk written beside the first is a second plan
 * and would leave a list of who walks unchanged.
 *
 * <p>What keeps those counts a population rather than a census of today's readers is the language,
 * and that is asked for on its own below. A modifier is what puts the constructor and the indexes
 * out of reach, and a modifier changing moves nothing either count would see.
 *
 * <p>Read off the compiled classes, so what is counted is what a method does rather than what a
 * reading of the sources makes of it. The tests are not in {@code target/classes}, so a plan built
 * by a fixture to drive a reader into a state no source reaches is not among these.
