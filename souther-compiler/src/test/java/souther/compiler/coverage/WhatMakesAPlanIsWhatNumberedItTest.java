/**
 * A plan is made where its bodies are numbered, and nowhere else in the compiler.
 *
 * <p>A plan holds parts that are only true together: a numbering of comparisons and the catalog
 * that issued their names, and what each number addresses beside the sites it was handed out for.
 * Its own constructor refuses the pairs it can see — a comparison the catalog never held, an
 * address list of another length — and there are agreements no constructor can see. What each
 * number is an address <em>of</em> is one: a list of the right length, of addresses of the right
 * places, is a value anybody could build and only the walk that handed the numbers out knows.
 *
 * <p>So what is fixed is who may put one together. One walk numbers a module's bodies and makes the
 * plan of them in the same breath, and a plan that exists is that walk's answer rather than parts a
 * caller believed went together.
 *
 * <p>Read off the compiled classes, so what is counted is what a method does rather than what a
 * reading of the sources makes of it.
 *
 * <p><b>What it does not see, said rather than left to be found.</b> The tests are not in
 * {@code target/classes}: a fixture that hands the emitter a plan with one arm too many is standing
 * in for a numbering that got it wrong, which is the thing under test there and is not a second
 * answer inside the compiler. And what is read is this module's classes — a caller written in the
 * CLI or the language server would not be counted here, and those modules are built after this one,
 * so a walk over their output would read whatever the last build left.
