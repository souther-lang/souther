/**
 * What a reading of a body reads can be keyed by what the model states there.
 *
 * <p>A rule is read where the language's operations stand and a run through it is recorded where
 * they are expanded, so a reader that holds a fact about a rule and a reader that holds a recording
 * are reading different trees. What they join on has to name every comparison a reading reads, name
 * no two of them alike, and be the same value however the reading was reached. None of that is
 * something the types promise, and this asks the models.
 *
 * <p><b>Where the crossing is partial.</b> A construct written inside one of the language's own
 * operations is one the model states nothing at, and the operation stands in the tree a reading is
 * taken over — so such a construct is not in that tree to be read. The absence is on the side where
 * the operations have been expanded, and what says so is asked here rather than left to be read off
 * the code that answers it.
 *
 * <p><b>The population is every module the corpora hold, and models written for shapes no corpus
 * has.</b> A helper called twice, an operation of the language that evaluates a closure it was handed
 * twice, and a call of one whose own body compares something: measured without them, the questions
 * below are answered by walks that never met a second copy of anything, and one of them is answered
 * by a walk that never met the absence it is about.
