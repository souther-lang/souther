/**
 * A numbering for a fixture that has places in mind and no bodies to walk.
 *
 * <p>What a test writing "the arm numbered 3" needs. An address is issued by a numbering and
 * nothing else, which is what stops one being made up next to a run it is not about; a test that
 * writes a number is standing in for the walk that would have handed it out, and this is that
 * stand-in said out loud rather than a way round the rule.
 *
 * <p>Two calls asking for the same places come to the same numbering, so two fixtures that both
 * write "arm 3" hold one address. That is what a numbering is — a value two derivations agree on —
 * and it is why a fixture need not pass one construction around to keep its places together. Two
 * calls asking for <em>different</em> places are different numberings, and an address of one is no
 * address of the other.
