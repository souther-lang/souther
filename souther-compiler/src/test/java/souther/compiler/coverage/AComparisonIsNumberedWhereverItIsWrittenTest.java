/**
 * A comparison an author wrote is numbered, wherever in a condition the tree that runs put it.
 *
 * <p>What a site is for is saying that a run reached the comparison. A comparison with none cannot
 * be said to have run and cannot be said not to have — it is absent from the accounting rather than
 * unmet in it, which is the one answer no reader can act on and no count can be short by.
 *
 * <p>The condition of the fork inside a library combinator is not a comparison. A closure handed to
 * {@code List.filter} is inlined as a binding of the element with the author's own comparison under
 * it, so the condition is a {@code let} and the comparison is one level in. Numbered only through
 * the connectives, every comparison an author wrote inside a closure went unnumbered — measured on
 * {@code develop} at {@code 2130fb2f}, where both comparisons below came back with no site at all.
 *
 * <p>Two closures rather than one, because the fix has to keep them apart. They are the same fork of
 * the same library declaration, inlined twice; what tells them apart is which comparison each was
 * handed, and a site keyed on the fork would give them one number between them.
