/**
 * A run is read as places of the numbering it was recorded under, and of no other.
 *
 * <p>This is the crossing the whole numbering exists for. What a run leaves behind is numbers; what
 * a number means is a place under the numbering that handed it out. Read under another numbering,
 * every number still resolves — the other numbering has numbers too — and what comes back is an
 * ordinary answer about places the run was never near. Nothing downstream can tell that from a
 * right one, so it is refused here.
 *
 * <p><b>The other numbering is the same size and numbers different places.</b> A numbering that is
 * shorter would be caught by the number falling off the end, which is a different mechanism and one
 * that happens to fire; the case to hold is the one where nothing about the numbers themselves is
 * wrong.
 *
 * <p>And two numberings of the same places are one, which is the other half: the refusal is about
 * what a numbering is rather than about which construction made it, so a recording read under a
 * numbering derived a second time is read and not refused.
