/**
 * Whether a run was at a place is asked of the run, and not of the set it holds.
 *
 * <p>{@link AlignedObservation#lit} and {@link AlignedObservation#saw} refuse a place of another
 * numbering: what one numbering's run did at another's places is nothing, and an ordinary "no"
 * there says a row missed somewhere it was never asked about. Reached through
 * {@link AlignedObservation#arms} instead, the same question is a {@code Set.contains} and answers
 * that "no" — so the refusal holds only for as long as every reader asks the run rather than
 * reaching past it.
 *
 * <p><b>Which is not a reason to take the sets away.</b> Gathering what a run holds is a different
 * act from asking it about a place: a caller unioning the arms of every row is not naming a place
 * at all, and has nothing to be wrong about. So what is fixed is who may take the set, and each of
 * them says which of the two it is doing.
 *
 * <p>Read off the compiled classes, so what is counted is what a method does rather than what a
 * reading of the sources makes of it — a call written inside a lambda belongs to the lambda, and
 * this says so.
 *
 * <p><b>What it does not see, said rather than left to be found.</b> The tests are not in
 * {@code target/classes}, and what is read is this module's classes: a reader written in the CLI or
 * the language server would not be counted here. Both are things to be told about rather than
 * things this can be widened to cover.
