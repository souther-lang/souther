/**
 * Re-issuing the numbers the compiler minted for a body's names leaves what the body does alone.
 *
 * <p>The one thing {@link ExecutableIdentity} exists to be. A {@code BindingId} is an owner and a
 * count over that owner's bindings, and both are minted while the body is being built: an expansion
 * owns each copy it makes and numbers copies in the order it makes them. So a reading that carried
 * them would say two builds of one source built different things as soon as the inliner allocated
 * differently — which is the dependency the whole of this is moving off, not a dependency to move
 * one level down.
 *
 * <p>So the numbers are re-issued here and the answer must not move. Done to the bindings a body
 * binds, which are the ones minted: a parameter is bound by the signature, in the order it was
 * written, and moving one of those is a different body — which the last test below is.
 *
 * <p>The rewrite is a fixture and not a pass. What it does to the tree is what a differently
 * allocating inliner would have left, and nothing downstream sees it.
