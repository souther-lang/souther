/**
 * Who takes a plan's numbering, written down with what makes it safe where it stands.
 *
 * <p>{@link CoverageSites.Plan#NONE} is the plan of nothing, and two different callers reach for
 * it: the emitter told to write no probes, and a measure of a module whose bodies did not come out.
 * For the first it is what it says. For the second it is a stand-in — and a stand-in has a
 * numbering, which is nobody's: not of that module, and over no places. A recording of the module
 * aligned against that is refused as a run of somewhere read under a numbering of nowhere, which is
 * right and is not the answer wanted. A module with no bodies has no numbering, and what a reader
 * without one has is no account of any run.
 *
 * <p>Which is why a reader that wants a numbering asks the check for the one it issued rather than
 * for a plan of its own to take one off. The check answers off the plan it made and kept, which is
 * of the bodies it holds; a reader reaching for any other plan is one branch away from the stand-in,
 * and where the bodies are there is no answer at all rather than an empty one.
 *
 * <p><b>Two things a taker does with one, and the stand-in is dangerous to one of them.</b> A
 * numbering read as an address space says a run happened at these places, and taken off the
 * stand-in it says that of nowhere. A numbering read as a name says which plan a value is of, and
 * is only ever compared with another taken the same way — two readers of the plan of nothing agree
 * they hold the plan of nothing, which is true. The reason beside each entry says which of the two
 * it is doing.
 *
 * <p><b>What this holds is the population, and not that each of them is right.</b> A walk over the
 * compiled classes sees which method takes a numbering off a plan; it does not see which plan, so
 * it cannot tell a reader holding the checked bodies from one holding the stand-in. That is what
 * the reason beside each entry is for, and it is read by a person. What the check itself stops is a
 * new reader appearing without one — which is how the reader this was written for got in.
 *
 * <p>Read off the compiled classes, so what is counted is what a method does rather than what a
 * reading of the sources makes of it. The tests are not in {@code target/classes}, and what is read
 * is this module's classes.
