/**
 * When two numberings of one module are one, and when they are two.
 *
 * <p>What everything else here is for. A run is recorded in bare numbers; a number means a place
 * only under the numbering that handed it out; so a measure reading a recording is answering about
 * the places that recording is of, or about other places and saying nothing either way. The parts
 * are held on their own — where a place is, what a body does, where a name is bound — and this is
 * the whole of them: the answer a reader would act on.
 *
 * <p>Written as the two directions together, because either alone is easy and wrong. Called equal
 * whenever the source is the same, a numbering says nothing and refuses nothing; called equal only
 * for the very same construction, it refuses every recomputation and the store recomputes.
