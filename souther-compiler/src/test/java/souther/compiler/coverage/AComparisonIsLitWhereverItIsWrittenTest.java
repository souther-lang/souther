/**
 * A comparison the plan numbers is one a run through it records, wherever it is written.
 *
 * <p>The numbering and the emission are one agreement, and this is the side of it a plan cannot
 * check. What a probe does is copy the value the comparison left on the stack, so a number handed to
 * a place that leaves something else there is a class the verifier refuses — which is what happened
 * the first time this numbering was widened without asking what the operator was.
 *
 * <p>Run rather than read, and over the shapes the numbering gained. A comparison given a name
 * before the fork that tests it, one inside a function value handed to a combinator, and one a
 * behavior answers with were numbered nowhere before, so nothing had ever asked the emitter to light
 * one — and a plan that names a site the emitter never lights is a hit no count can tell from a real
 * one.
