/**
 * A run made up to be exactly what some claims name.
 *
 * <p>What a fixture reaches for when the question is what a reader does with a run, rather than what
 * running produces. The places come off the claims, so a fixture cannot write a run at a place no
 * claim is about — which is the mistake that makes such a test pass for a reason nobody chose.
 *
 * <p>Which numbering it is a run of is said rather than gathered from whatever the claims turned out
 * to hold: a run of no claims is still a run of some numbering, and a fixture that let the claims
 * decide would have none to name for it. A claim about a place of another numbering is refused
 * here, because that is a fixture saying two things at once.
 *
 * <p>Already aligned, because there is nothing to align: the places are places. A fixture that
 * wants the crossing itself tested writes an {@link Observation} and calls
 * {@link SiteNumbering#align}.
