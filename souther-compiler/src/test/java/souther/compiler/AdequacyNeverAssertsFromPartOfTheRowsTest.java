/**
 * One rule, asked of every measure at once.
 *
 * <p>The rule is: <em>found</em> may be said from part of the rows, and <em>not found</em> may not.
 * Every measure here answers over a population, and each of them has at some point claimed the second
 * from an incomplete one — the signature, the positions, the combinations, the boundaries, the arms,
 * and the generator, each found separately, each fixed separately.
 *
 * <p>So this asks all of them together. It walks what a report can say about one behavior and fails on
 * any measure that reports a gap while calling itself complete, over models where something was
 * demonstrably not read. A new measure added later is covered by the same walk, and a new way for a
 * reading to go missing shows up in every measure at once rather than in whichever one someone
 * happened to look at.
