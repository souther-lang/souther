/**
 * A report says what the search for a row was looked over, where the way to the line is not all in
 * it.
 *
 * <p>A row for a border a guard owes is looked for in the region that reaches the guard, and the
 * same sentence came out whether that region was the declarations because nothing stood on the way,
 * or the declarations because a condition above could not be read. The second is a limit of this
 * compiler and the first is not, and an author told only that a search composed nothing had no way
 * to find out that a guard above the one they are looking at is why.
 *
 * <p>Two models whose conditions above the line differ in whether this reading has words for one.
 * Not a controlled pair beyond that: a readable condition draws a line of its own and narrows the
 * region below it, so which points a search settles is not the same on both sides — which is the
 * mechanism working rather than a difference to hold against. What is held here is the sentence: it
 * is there where something on the way was not accounted for, it is absent where everything was, and
 * it is added to what the search already said rather than replacing it.
