 * below it are not reported at all.
 *
 * <p>What is wrong is the import, and an author sent to each use instead is sent to the wrong place
 * as many times as the model writes the name. So the name stays in scope denoting nothing, and a use
 * of it takes the error type.
 *
 * <p>Held here rather than on the mechanism. The scope used to hold a {@code TypeName} of a module
 * no source may name for this, which is why every reader below it had to ask whether the identity it
 * had was really one; the answer is a {@code Denotation} now. Either way what must be true is what a
 * build says, and nothing said it before this.
