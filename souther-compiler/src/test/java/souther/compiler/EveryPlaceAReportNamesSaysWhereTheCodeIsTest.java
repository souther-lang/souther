 * it at that. Nothing held them against each other, and each was written believing the place was the
 * place.
 *
 * <p>Two subjects rather than one, because there were two. An unreached arm is what was reported
 * — of {@code List.filter}, in the model this was found on. A line a guard drew is the other, and it
 * was found by looking for the first one's shape somewhere else: the same compile said
 * {@code guard@7:22} two lines above an arm of the same body saying where it was written.
 *
 * <p>Of one compile, and every rendering held to the same declaration. Renderings read from separate
 * runs are compared by way of the compiler answering the same thing twice, which is a different
 * claim; and four tests each pinned to the same name agree by construction, so a fifth comparing
 * them to one another could not fail on its own.
 *
 * <p>No module path is needed. The standard library is out of sight of every compile, so this is what
 * any model that calls into it looks like.
