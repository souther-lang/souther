/**
 * A row is composed inside the environment the module already states.
 *
 * <p>A {@code fake} block is what a module says its rows run against, and every row somebody writes
 * runs against it. A row this compiler composes is a row somebody is about to write, so it is
 * composed against the same thing: what the module answers is left answered, and the row writes at
 * a dependency only what it has to say of its own.
 *
 * <p>Two things follow, and they are the two this holds. A way needing one dependency to answer
 * differently at different calls is a way a row cannot write a value for — and the module's table
 * answers call by call, so wherever a module states one there is a row for such a way after all,
 * where before this compiler said only that a table was what it needed. And a way asking nothing of
 * a dependency is left to the table rather than written over: a row writing its own value there
 * would be certified in an environment none of the module's own rows are in, and would go somewhere
 * else the moment it was pasted in beside them.
 *
 * <p>Whether the table answers what a way needs is not decided while the row is composed. It is
 * what the run finds, which is what a trial is for — the table is read where the table is, and a
 * second reading of it here would be the reading rather than the fact.
