/**
 * A position is measured at every number the rules name of it, and at every kind of thing they say.

 * <p>One location carries one axis no longer. {@code Time.hour} and {@code Time.minute} are two
 * numbers of one time, a body comparing both draws two lines, and what a report said was that the
 * behavior divides no position and draws no line — the sentence a body with no comparison in it
 * gets, with the measurement called complete beside it.
 *
 * <p>Two things were behind it and each is measured here. Which numbers a position is measured at
 * was answered with the one a body names, so two were answered as none; and it was answered from
 * the lines alone, so a body that only singles a value out named none either.
