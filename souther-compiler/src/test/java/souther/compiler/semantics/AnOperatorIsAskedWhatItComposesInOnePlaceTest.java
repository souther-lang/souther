/**
 * Who reads an operator for what a connective composes, and how often.
 *
 * <p>Beside {@link souther.compiler.check.AnOperatorIsAskedWhatItPlacesInOnePlaceTest}, which holds
 * the recognition of a comparison to one call each. This holds the other recognition an operator is
 * read for, and for the same reason: below the point where a binary was recognised as a connective
 * a reader holds {@link ConditionJoin}, which has no case for an operator that composes nothing, and
 * that stands only while nothing down there goes back to the operator.
 *
 * <p><b>How often, and not only where.</b> A method is licensed here for the question it asks, and
 * a second call inside it is that same node recognised twice — a walk with an arm per composition
 * asks the operator once per arm, which is the arrangement this value exists to end, one method
 * further in. So the count is part of what is declared.
 *
 * <p>What is not counted is what a reader does with the answer afterwards. Denying it and asking
 * for it under a polarity are operations on the value, and a reader may do either as often as it
 * meets a negation — that is the value being carried, which is the point.
 *
 * <p>Read off the compiled classes, because what a method calls is what the class file says. A
 * reading of the sources would answer the same question a second way, and would not see a call
 * written inside a lambda as the method that holds it.
