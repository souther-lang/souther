 * <p>Of the tree the checker produced, which is where the occurrence has to arrive. What the
 * inlining pass settled is on {@link souther.compiler.ast.Hir.Expansion}, and elaboration is what
 * carries it down onto the nodes a reader below holds — so a walk of the expansions says nothing
 * about whether a reader of a body can tell two copies of a comparison apart.
 *
 * <p>Both representations, walked apart. Which of them a comparison stands in is what an occurrence
 * must not turn on: the tree the backend emits has the language's own operations expanded into what
 * they do and the tree the analysis reads keeps them standing, so a comparison written inside one of
 * those operations stands in a copy in the first and is not in the second at all.
