/**
 * A kept call has the arguments the declaration it names takes.
 *
 * <p>What the readers below it stand on. A rule about an operation says which argument it is about
 * — by a written position, or by the part that argument plays — and the reader that finds it does
 * so without checking that the call has one there. That reading is right because of this and not
 * because of anything the reader does.
 *
 * <p>Said of the node rather than of the sites that build one. Three passes rebuild a kept call to
 * put something else in one of its arguments, and each of them carries the operation across
 * unchanged; a rebuild that dropped an argument or added one would be a call standing for a
 * declaration it does not fit, and the pass would have no reason to notice.
