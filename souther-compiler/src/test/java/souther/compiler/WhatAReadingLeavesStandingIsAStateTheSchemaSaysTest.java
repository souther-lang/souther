/**
 * What a reading leaves standing is a state the schema says, not one its prose describes.
 *
 * <p>`read` says how far one measure got with a position: whether the walk reached every rule, and
 * whether the questions that measure answers were answered. `extent` is the word over both. A
 * description saying "present exactly where" is a promise a consumer written against it will find
 * broken by the first document that breaks it, since nothing refuses one; the schema says what it
 * can in `oneOf`, and this holds the emitter to the rest.
 *
 * <p>The questions themselves are not in `read`. They are the model's and every measure is one
 * reader of them, so they are written once beside the measures — which is also what keeps a
 * question alive at a position no axis came back for.
