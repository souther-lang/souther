/**
 * A row goes only where the offering answers as much without it.
 *
 * <p>What is preserved is what the offering puts in front of a person for each item: a row that
 * settles it, or the row composed for it. Everything the rows offered for before, the rows that are
 * left offer for; and no row of what is left can go and leave that true.
 *
 * <p>The first of those is checked here in the narrower words as well — everything some row settled
 * is still settled — so that the two statements do not both rest on one method. The second reads
 * {@link Settlements#offers}, which is what the reduction preserves: written out again here, this
 * test and the reduction would be two statements of one contract.
 *
 * <p>And what may not be acted on. A row that cannot be told about is not a row that answers, so
 * nothing is dropped on the strength of one — a reduction that counted what it could not tell would
 * drop the row that was the only offer for something.
