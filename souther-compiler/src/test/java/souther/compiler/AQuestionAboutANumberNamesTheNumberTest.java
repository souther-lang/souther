 * document's {@code subject.measure} is written from the question, and it was written from the axis:
 * a position with no axis at all still has whatever was written about it, and the axis beside a
 * question is not always measured at the number that question is about.
 *

 * long a list is came back with the list's own path in the field that says which count the line
 * falls on — so a consumer reading the document was told that the line falls on a count and then
