/**
 * What a checked program says a module declares is what the checker resolved names against.
 *
 * <p>A compile holds a declaration in more than one tree. Two of them come back together and are
 * both an {@code Hir.Module} — one the declarations were settled in, one the bodies were lowered
 * into — so which of the two an assembler hands on is settled by the name of a local variable and
 * by nothing javac can see. Everything below the check resolves a name through the declaration
 * world, and that world is the one a reader of a checked program has to be reading too: a snapshot
 * taken from a tree that had been rewritten for some later stage's convenience would describe a
 * program the checker never saw, and would do it silently for as long as the rewrite left
 * declarations alone.
 *
 * <p>So the two are compared here. Not the snapshot against the tree it was taken from, which would
 * be an answer against itself, but against the world every other reader of a declaration asks —
 * {@code symbols.declarations()}, reached through the derived registry, which is what
 * {@code TypeOps} and {@code AtomSpace} answer over.
 *
 * <p>Inside {@code souther-compiler} because that world is the compiler's own and does not cross
 * the boundary. What the boundary hands out is checked from outside it, and this is the seam that
 * check cannot see.
