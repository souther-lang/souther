 * test has a document to hold to the schema and only one of them can make it. What a measure comes
 * to where it runs out of what it may spend is written in shapes no model of this repository
 * reaches, and saying what a measure may spend is only possible from where the measures live — so
 * the walk goes to the document rather than the document to the walk.
 *
 * <p>It is not a validator, and it refuses to look like one. What it understands is the set of
 * keywords listed below; meeting any other is a failure rather than something skipped, because a
 * walk that steps over what it does not know is a check that stops saying anything the moment the
