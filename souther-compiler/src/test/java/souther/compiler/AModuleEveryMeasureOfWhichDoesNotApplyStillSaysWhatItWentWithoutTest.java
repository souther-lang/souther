/**
 * The model issue #996 is written about.
 *
 * <p>Every measure counted over a behavior's rows may have nothing to be about. This one's output is
 * not a sum, its rules divide no position and draw no line, and it has no body — so all four answer
 * inapplicable, correctly, and none of them is weaker for anything. Its one row does not come back.
 *
 * <p>The reading of the rows is the measure that is left, and it is the one measure that can never
 * be inapplicable: a behavior has rows to read, even where there are none. Before it was one, what
 * the run went without reached the document only through the measures counted over the rows — so a
 * module where every one of those had nothing to be about reported {@code measurement: complete}
 * under a line saying a row of it did not come back.
