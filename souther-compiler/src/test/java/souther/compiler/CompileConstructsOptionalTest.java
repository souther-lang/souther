/**
 * On an fn-backed behavior, {@code constructs} is optional (spec 12.3, ADR-0002): its construction
 * permission is internal — invisible to callers, unlike {@code depends on} — so with the body visible
 * the set can be inferred. Omit it and inference stands; declare it and it must match the body
 * exactly (under-declaration E1002, over-declaration E1006). Injected behaviors still declare it.
