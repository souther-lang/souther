 * A clause states a condition, and what says so is the elaboration of it.
 *
 * <p>Written because that reading moved. Typing a clause and running it were two elaborations, and
 * the check's was the one that dropped what it made (issue #1080); now there is one, and it is the
 * one the emitter reads. A clause that is not a condition has to be refused by it — a reading that
 * only produced a value would let a module through and hand a backend a boolean check with a number
 * in it.
