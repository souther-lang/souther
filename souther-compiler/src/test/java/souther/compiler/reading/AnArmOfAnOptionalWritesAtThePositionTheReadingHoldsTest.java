/**
 * What a body writes inside {@code | Some v} is written at the position the reading of the input
 * holds for that narrowing.
 *
 * <p>The integration invariant, and it is a different claim from the one the two vocabularies
 * answer alike. That one is about a narrowing: given an optional, the division its type states and
 * the selector a pattern selecting it carries come to the same {@link Refinement}. This one is
 * about a path: the reading of a body, walking through the arm, arrives at a location the reading
 * of the input can be asked about. Both were true of a sum's arm and only the first is enough to
 * make the second so — a producer can hold the right narrowing and still put it after the wrong
 * steps.
 *
 * <p>What made this worth a test of its own is that the two came apart silently. The reading of an
 * arm built its narrowing from the case's name, which spells an optional's present carrier and a
 * sum's case alike, so a body inside {@code | Some v} wrote at {@code x@Some} carrying a sum's case
 * while the input's reading held {@code x@Some} carrying a presence. Nothing compared the two: most
 * readers look a path up, find nothing and say nothing, and the one that refuses raised in the
 * middle of a report and took the whole model's with it (#1252).
 *
 * <p>Read as the location a comparison is about rather than as a line of a report. What a report
 * prints about such a position is a further question and moves with how it is worded; what may not
 * move is that the two readings meet at one place.
