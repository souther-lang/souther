/**
 * A comparison on a number taken of a location settles a decision, and a row is steered by it.
 *
 * <p>Whether a value brings a comparison out a given way is a question about the number it compares:
 * the rules leave that number a run of values, and a way stands where some value of the run falls on
 * the side the way needs. Read off the shape of the operands instead, {@code String.length(slot.c)
 * <= 3} is a call against a literal and nothing about it varies — so no way was held, no decision was
 * named, and the arm behind the guard was left with no row and nothing saying why.
 *
 * <p>What a row for such an arm needs beside the decision is a value to write, and that is a separate
 * capability with a separate answer. The last case below is the one where the decision is settled and
 * the value cannot be written: the combination is asked for and comes back as one nothing composes,
 * which is what an author can act on. Run together, the way to get there would be to leave the
 * decision unnamed, which is where this started.
