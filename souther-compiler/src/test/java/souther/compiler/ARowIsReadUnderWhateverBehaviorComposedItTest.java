/**
 * A row is read under the behavior that composed it, whatever else that behavior was asked.
 *
 * <p>A line a declaration draws is owed a row once over every behavior carrying the type, and the
 * row is composed by whichever reading could compose it. That behavior need not be one anything else
 * was asked about — an offering holds the row under it either way, which is what
 * {@link Composition#composed} says in as many words.
 *
 * <p>Read off the searches instead, such a row has no reading at all: every question put to it comes
 * back as one nothing could tell about, so nothing it stands at can make another row redundant and
 * the two go out as two pieces of work. Which is this issue's own defect, on the side nobody
 * measured.
