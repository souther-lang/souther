/**
 * What the conformance corpus has to reach, asked of the language rather than of a list kept beside
 * it.
 *
 * <p>A corpus is written to cover something, and the covering is the whole of its value: a model
 * that reaches most of the language answers most of the question and says nothing about which part
 * it left out. Judging that by reading it does not survive the language growing — a form added
 * tomorrow is one nobody thought to look for.
 *
 * <p>So every claim here reads a declaration the language already keeps for its own reasons —
 * {@link TopLevelForm}, {@link CstLexer#keywords()}, {@link Reserved#MODULES} — and reports what the
 * corpus does not reach. Nothing is written out beside those, because a written-out copy is a second
 * table that goes on agreeing with the first only until one of them changes.
 *
 * <p>Japanese identifiers are the one thing here with no enum behind them. They are a fact about the
 * lexer rather than about any domain, and a corpus written in English reaches none of them, so the
 * claim is made directly.
 *
 * <p>Not every construct is a form the parser opens. Where a behavior's body comes from and whether
 * the module writing about it is the one that declared it are two enumerations the language already
 * keeps, and what a corpus reaches of their product is asked here as the tokens are asked above —
 * computed from the corpus rather than written out beside it.
