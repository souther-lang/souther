/**
 * A model written to be compiled here, and what this compiler answers about it.
 *
 * <p>Written rather than copied. A model taken from somewhere it was written for its own reasons
 * reaches the constructs that domain happened to need and no others, and it changes for reasons
 * that have nothing to do with this compiler. What is here is written against what the language
 * declares, and {@link AConformanceCorpusReachesEveryConstructTheLanguageDeclaresTest} says which
 * of those it does not reach yet.
 *
 * <p>A corpus is a directory of {@code .sou} files plus a {@code sources.txt} naming them in the
 * order they are handed over, and {@code corpora.txt} names the directories and what each was
 * written for. Both are written out rather than discovered because a jar has no directory to list,
 * and because the order is part of what is compiled: a file of {@code examples for} a module is read
 * after the module it is attached to.
 *
 * <p><b>The models and the answers about them are kept apart.</b> The sources are the repository's,
 * owned by {@code souther-test-support} so that every module reaches the same ones whichever side of
 * the compiler it sits on; what this compiler answers about them is this module's and is checked in
 * here. Which corpora are conformance corpora is read off the manifest below and stated nowhere
 * else.
