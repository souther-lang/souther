/**
 * A choice is taken while a reading is a description, and a built one has no way to form another.
 *
 * <p>Which alternatives anybody can be in is a question about the values and the order together, so
 * it is settled over {@link PlannedValues} and what is built afterwards is built from a description
 * a choice has already been taken in. A built reading keeps what that choice left, is asked about
 * it, and is conjoined with the readings of other declarations. Given an operation that turns two
 * of them into one that is not a conjunction, a caller could take a choice on this side of
 * {@link PlannedValues#resolve} — where neither the order nor which branches stand is in hand — and
 * the answer would be settled by whichever half of the question that caller happened to hold.
 *
 * <p><b>Said positively.</b> What is fixed is which operations may turn two readings into one, and
 * not that no method is called {@code join}: a second spelling under another name would pass a rule
 * written about the name. Every entry below is a conjunction or a lifting of one reading into a
 * conjunction of one, and a new one is a decision somebody has to make rather than a line to add.
 *
 * <p>What is not fixed here is that a reading never reaches the arithmetic a choice is realized by.
 * It does, legitimately: {@link AdmissibleValues.Held.Alternatives} asks the allowance what a block
 * holds across the alternatives it already has, which is a fact derived from a choice already taken
 * and not a choice being taken. The two are told apart by whether two readings go in, which is what
 * is read below.
