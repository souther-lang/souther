/**
 * Which position a reading that admits nothing leaves empty does not follow the brackets.
 *
 * <p>A reading may admit nothing because some position is left no value, or because the rules
 * cannot hold together with no one position at fault. The two are different answers and a reader
 * acts on which it is — so the answer has to be about the rules and not about the order they were
 * met in.
 *
 * <p>It is a pointwise question, and the alternatives cannot answer it. A conjunction meets them
 * pairwise and drops the pairs nothing stands in, so a pair that died leaves no trace once another
 * survives — and what it was going to say about a position leaves with it. Met in another order the
 * same rules blame a position no rule of theirs leaves empty:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     X = a == 0 &amp;&amp; b == 0
 *     Y = a == 0
 *     Z = (a == 1 &amp;&amp; b == 0) || (a == 0 &amp;&amp; b == 1)
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Nothing satisfies the three of them. Read one position at a time they leave {@code a} at
 * {@code 0} and {@code b} at {@code 0}, so neither is a position the rules leave nothing at — what
 * they cannot do is hold together. A reading that answered {@code b} empty would send an author to
 * a rule about {@code b} that is not the reason.
