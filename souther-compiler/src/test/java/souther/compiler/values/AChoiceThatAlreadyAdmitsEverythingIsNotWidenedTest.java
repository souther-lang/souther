 * admits every value there is, so there is nothing wider for an unread rule to widen it to — and a
 * reading that answered otherwise would report a position the model leaves open as one it could not
 * follow.
 *
 * <p><b>Whichever way the alternatives are bracketed.</b> {@code ||} is one connective and not a

 * {@code a || (b || c)} is reading the brackets. That is what the guarantee is carried for: the
 * alternatives that can be read cover the position between them, and the reading has to still know
