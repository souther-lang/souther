/**
 * What a reading may promise about the values it reports, which is two questions and not one.
 *
 * <p>What is held is one set per position, standing for the product of them. A choice between
 * alternatives written at two positions is a union of two products, and the smallest product holding
 * that union is the pair of unions — so the relation is lost there. The projections are not: the
 * projection of a union is the union of the projections, so what each position is reported as
 * holding is still exactly what the read rules leave it.
 *
 * <p>It is the next conjunction that spends what the choice lost. Two such readings are met one
 * position at a time, and a pair the two of them refuse between them is a pair neither intersection
 * can exclude — so the values come back wider than the rules are with every rule read.
 *
 * <p>Both are what this reading can prove and not what is true of the model. A conservative rule may
 * answer false where the values happen to be exact, which is why they are read as guarantees: what
 * they say holds, and what they do not say is unknown.
 *
 * <p><b>Said of a choice whose alternatives are merged</b> — {@code join} here, which is what a
 * declaration too large to hold them apart is read by. Held apart the same witness is answered
 * exactly, and that is {@link AlternativesHeldApartAnswerThePositionExactlyTest}.
