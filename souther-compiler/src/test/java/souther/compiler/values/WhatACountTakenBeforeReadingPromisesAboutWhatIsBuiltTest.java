/**
 * A reading builds no more alternatives than were counted for it before it started.
 *
 * <p>A declaration is admitted under a count taken from its clauses before any of them is read, and
 * the whole of why that is enough is this. The count is a fold — a leaf costs one, a choice adds
 * and a conjunction multiplies — so the promise is an induction, and what is held here are its
 * steps. The base is that a leaf holds one alternative; the steps are that a choice holds at most
 * the sum and a conjunction at most the product.
 *
 * <p>Held at the connectives rather than only at the end of a real reading. The end of a reading is
 * where the two are tied together (an assertion in the check, over declarations a corpus happens to
 * hold), and what that catches is that they came apart; this is where they are kept from coming
 * apart, at the two operations either of them could be changed at.
 *
 * <p>What makes the induction reach the reading at all is that the count and the reading are one
 * {@link souther.compiler.check.ClauseReading} fold over the same clauses: a connective is
 * interpreted in one place, so there is no second walk to disagree about which shape is a choice.
