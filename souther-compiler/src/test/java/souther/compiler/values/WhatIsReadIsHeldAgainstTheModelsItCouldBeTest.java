/**
 * Every reading is held against the models it could be about.
 *
 * <p>The other tests here compare answers this code produced with answers this code produced. They
 * catch a reading that contradicts itself and cannot catch one that agrees with itself about the
 * wrong thing. This one writes down what a rule means — a set of the values a whole record may take
 * — composes those sets by the connectives, and asks whether the reading is true of the result.
 *
 * <p>Three things are asked of every reading over every model it could be about:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     at(p)             holds every value the model leaves at p          an upper approximation
 *     guaranteedAt(p)   holds none the model does not leave at p         a lower one
 *     speaksFor(p)      only where at(p) is exactly what the model leaves
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>A rule this reading has no word for is not one model but every model it could be: any reading
 * that narrows only the positions the rule names. Two positions over a carrier of two values give
 * sixteen sets of records, so the whole of that can be enumerated rather than sampled.
 *
 * <p><b>Two assumptions of the reading are written into the model, because they are what a
 * conjunction's account of an unread rule rests on.</b> A rule this could not read narrows only the
 * positions it names, and leaves the type with a value in it. Without the first, a rule naming
 * nothing could narrow everything and no conjunction could speak for any position; without the
 * second, one could empty the type and every answer about every position would be wrong. Both are
 * what {@code AdmissibleValues} says of itself, and a model that let them go would be testing a
 * different language.
