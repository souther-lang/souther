/**
 * Every reading is held against the models it could be about.
 *
 * <p>The other tests here compare answers this code produced with answers this code produced. They
 * catch a reading that contradicts itself and cannot catch one that agrees with itself about the
 * wrong thing. This one writes down what a rule means — a set of the values a whole record may take
 * — composes those sets by the connectives, and asks whether the reading is true of the result.
 *
 * <p>Three things are asked of every reading over every model it could be about:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     at(p)             holds every value the model leaves at p          an upper approximation
 *     guaranteedAt(p)   holds none the model does not leave at p         a lower one
 *     speaksFor(p)      only where at(p) is exactly what the model leaves
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>A rule this reading has no word for is not one model but every model it could be: any reading
 * that narrows only the positions the rule names. Two positions over a carrier of two values give
 * sixteen sets of records, so the whole of that can be enumerated rather than sampled.
 *
 * <p><b>One assumption of the reading is written into the model, because it is what a conjunction's
 * account of an unread rule rests on.</b> A rule this could not read narrows only the positions it
 * names. Without it a rule naming nothing could narrow everything, and no conjunction could speak
 * for any position. It is what {@code AdmissibleValues} says of itself, and a model that let it go
 * would be testing a different language.
 *
 * <p><b>That the type is left with a value in it is asked of the whole and not of a rule.</b> The
 * three questions above are about what stands at a position, which is a question about a type that
 * has a value — a model leaving none is what {@code isBottom} is for. Required of each rule
 * instead, a choice would be read only against models in all of which both its alternatives stand,
 * and what a reading says on the strength of a branch nobody may be in would never be asked about.

     * one leaves, so the reading would take back a position on the strength of a branch nobody can
     * be in.

     * where both were read, so the clause nothing read is the third.
