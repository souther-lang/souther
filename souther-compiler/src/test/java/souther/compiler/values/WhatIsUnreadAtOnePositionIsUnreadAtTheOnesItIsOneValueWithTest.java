/**
 * A rule that went unread at one position, read as a rule about every position holding that value.
 *
 * <p>Whether a reading speaks for what stands at a position is a question about the value, and a
 * value several positions are held as one is one value — so a rule nobody could read at any of them
 * is a rule about all of them. Answered per position, a reading reported that every rule about
 * {@code r} had been taken in while handing it the answer the unread rule about {@code p} was going
 * to narrow.
 *
 * <p>And the two halves of the answer — whether it speaks for the position and what stopped it —
 * are one derivation. Written apart, the first was asked of the value and the second read the
 * position's own reasons, so a position came out unanswerable with nothing to say for it.
