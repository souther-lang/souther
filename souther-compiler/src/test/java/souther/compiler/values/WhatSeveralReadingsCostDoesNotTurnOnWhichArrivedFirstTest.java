 * <p>Two orders and they are about different things. Which of the readings is built into which
 * first is a question about the machines, and it is settled by what the readings hold — so the same
 * readings come out the same, and cost the same, whichever of them a caller happened to hold first.
 * What is written down about each position is the other one: those are the author's rules going
 * unread, and a reader is shown them in the order they were written.
 *
 * <p>Kept apart because a fold that served both served neither. Ordered by content throughout, a
 * report listed an author's rules by a rule of this compiler's; ordered by arrival throughout, what
 * a model could be told exactly turned on which declaration this compiler read first.
