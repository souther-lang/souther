/**
 * The denials a reading was told, as it was told them.
 *
 * <p>A denial is between two positions and comes to a pair of blocks, and which blocks those are is
 * settled by everything the reading holds as one value. A conjunction is where that is found out, so
 * what it costs a reading to conjoin is what this decides: told as positions, the denials of two
 * readings are put together and nothing is carried anywhere.
 *
 * <p>Three things follow that a model cannot show, because what a model shows is which declarations
 * are refused and these are all rules about what a refusal costs to reach.
 *
 * <p>That the denials are read out once each and in the order they were first stated. That reading
 * them back is not a limit on how many there may be, nor on how often a caller says the same thing —
 * a reading states one denial at a time, so what a long one composes is as deep as it is long, and
 * nothing is copied when two are said together.
 *
 * <p>And that a denial whose ends the reading came to hold as one value still empties it. Which of
 * the two readings being conjoined was the one holding them apart is not something the answer may
 * turn on, so it is asked both ways round.
