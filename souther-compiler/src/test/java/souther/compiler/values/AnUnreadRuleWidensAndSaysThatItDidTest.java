/**
 * What a reading that could not take a rule in leaves, and what it says about having left it.
 *
 * <p>The whole risk of reading values out of rules is here. A reading that answers "no value" from a
 * rule it did not read refuses a model somebody can write, so a rule left unread has to widen and
 * never narrow; and a position left wide because a rule was unread is not a position the model says
 * nothing about, so the two have to be told apart.
 *
 * <p>The connectives do not treat an unread rule alike, which is what these are written around. A
 * rule stated beside others only narrows, so one that went unread costs precision at the positions
 * it named. A rule stated as an alternative to others widens, so one that went unread takes back
 * everything the other alternative said — including at positions it never mentions.
