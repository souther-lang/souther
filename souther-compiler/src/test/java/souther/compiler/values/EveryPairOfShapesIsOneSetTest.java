/**
 * Every pair of shapes a set of values comes in is one set, and says what it holds.
 *
 * <p>Three shapes make nine ways to meet and nine to join, and what each of them says is a claim
 * about which values are in the answer. So each is asked that way — over a sample of values, against
 * what the two sides say about each of them.
 *
 * <p>Which is what a shape added has to be held to. A shape whose operations are exact against the
 * two that were here already and guessed at against itself is one whose meet is not a meet, and the
 * answer is a set either way — so nothing downstream would find out.
 *
 * <p>Asked of {@link Allowance}, since that is where two of these are put together. Every pair below is
 * within what one answer is allowed, so nothing here is given up on and what is read is the
 * algebra.
