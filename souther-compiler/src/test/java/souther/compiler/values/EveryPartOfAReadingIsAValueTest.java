/**
 * A reading is a value: nothing it holds can be changed after it is made.

 * <p>What a query graph stops work on is whether an answer equals the one before it, so an answer
 * whose parts a caller can reach into is not an answer. A reading handed out with the map its maker
 * happened to be holding is one whose {@code equals} moves after it was compared, and — where it
 * admits nothing — one whose {@link AdmissibleValues#at} moves too.
 *
 * <p><b>Asked of every part, counted from the record itself.</b> The constructor copies the parts by
 * name, so a part added later is one it does not copy and nobody notices: the reading is still a
 * record, still equal to itself, and wrong only for a caller that kept the map it passed in. Written
 * out here as a list of parts to check, this test would be a copy of that constructor with the same
 * hole in it. Read off {@link Class#getRecordComponents}, a part added later is one it asks about.
