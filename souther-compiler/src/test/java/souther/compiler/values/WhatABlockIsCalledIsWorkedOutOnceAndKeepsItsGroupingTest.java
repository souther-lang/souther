/**
 * A block is asked what it is called far more often than one is made, and what it answers says
 * which positions are in it rather than only which positions there are.
 *
 * <p>A relation's answers are filed under blocks, so a round of a narrowing reads a map of them for
 * every block it walks and a reading asks which block a position is on for every position it reads.
 * Worked out from the members on each of those, the answer is a walk of the set for a value that
 * cannot change — which is what the first of these is about.
 *
 * <p>Having the answer is also what lets two blocks be told apart without reading either, which is
 * the second of these. It is worth nothing where a map asked the question, since a map compares the
 * names before it asks; it is worth a set walk where two blocks in hand are compared.
 *
 * <p>The rest are about what that answer is. A set's hash is the sum of its members', so a block
 * that answered with that sum and nothing else would be one whose name adds up the same however its
 * positions are grouped: a set of blocks would come to the sum over every position in all of them,
 * and the grouping a block exists to state would be the one thing its name leaves out. These do not
 * ask that two blocks never share a name — nothing can promise that of an {@code int} — but that
 * regrouping the same positions is not a thing the name is arranged to lose.
