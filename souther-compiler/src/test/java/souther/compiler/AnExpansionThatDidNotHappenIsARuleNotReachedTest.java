/**
 * A declaration whose clauses could not be worked out is a rule this reading did not reach, and not
 * a declaration that states nothing.
 *
 * <p>The two are the same empty list and opposite facts. One says a position holds every value its
 * type has and the model agrees; the other says the model was never asked. A reading handed the
 * second as the first reports a position as unconstrained, and nothing anywhere says it did not
 * look — which is the defect this whole change is about, one rung down from where it was found.
 *
 * <p>Reached by a module whose own values are not well founded, which is the one way to have a
 * declaration that resolves and an expansion that does not: its names are answered, so an importer
 * has the type and can write a behavior over it, and nothing expands its bodies, so there is no
 * representation of its clauses to be had. The cycle is that module's own error and is reported
 * there; what is held here is what the module beside it is told.
 *
 * <p>Held against the same model with the cycle removed. A run where both come out alike is a run
 * where the absence was read as an answer.
