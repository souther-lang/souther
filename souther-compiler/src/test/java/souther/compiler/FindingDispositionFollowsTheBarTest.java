/**
 * What a build does about a finding is the bar's answer and the measurement's, together.
 *
 * <p>The distinction is decided in one place and was written down in none. A report printed four
 * findings as four bullets of one shape, a build refused over three of them, and the count the
 * refusal gave pointed at a list with a different number of entries in it. An author reading it
 * either wrote rows for everything printed — more than the build asks — or wrote one and ran again
 * to find out.
 *
 * <p>Both surfaces read {@link Adequacy.Finding#disposition(Adequacy.AdequacyBar)}, so what is
 * marked here and what the document says are the same answer rather than two readings of the
 * finding kinds.
 *
 * <p><b>And the answer moves with the bar rather than with the finding.</b> Which kinds are gaps
 * used to be a fact about the kind, and the sentence beside the pair below said so: a case no row
 * uses is a gap, a class no row is in is not. It is neither now — it is what the bar the build
 * asked for refuses over, and the same finding is reported under one bar and refused under another.
