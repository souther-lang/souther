/**
 * Which ways a comparison against a written whole number stands, one row per way.
 *
 * <p>Every answer here is a fact about a range: the number written is a value of it, and whether
 * anything lies beyond that number on the side a way needs is what the ends of {@code Int} decide.
 * So a comparison against an interior number stands both ways whichever way round it is written,
 * and one against the last number on the order loses the way that needs a value past it.
 *
 * <p><b>Written out rather than worked out.</b> The answers are the ones this reading gives, put
 * here as data, so that a reading which comes to them by another route is held to the same table.
 * A test that derived them would agree with whatever rule it derived them from, including a rule
 * that had the side of the comparison the wrong way round — which is the one slip a reading that
 * turns a comparison round can make, and the reason both ways of writing each comparison are here.
 *
 * <p>The two sides are positions of the input that nothing settled, so nothing about the values is
 * known beyond what {@code Int} is. A comparison of two such positions is a different question and
 * is not asked here.
