/**
 * What decides a policy reads the answer; what writes a sentence writes one payload's words; and
 * what makes an answer is the reading that made it.
 *
 * <p>{@code Reachability} has three arms and each carries something: why nothing arrives, what says
 * something does, why nothing settled it. A reader that took one of those apart would be deciding
 * an obligation, a diagnostic or a claim on a distinction inside the payload — and a distinction
 * added there later would silently become a change to that decision.
 *
 * <p><b>Read off the compiled classes.</b> The arms being package-private stops the
 * {@code instanceof} and nothing else: {@code Words} and the factories are public, so a static
 * import or a qualified call reaches them, and a scan over source text answers about spellings
 * rather than about what a class does. What is checked here is what the bytecode says — who calls
 * {@code said}, who implements a {@code Words}, who calls a factory, and whose code runs an
 * answer's constructor — which no way of writing the call can dress up as something else.
 *
 * <p>Both directions are asserted. A check that only counts violations passes when it reads nothing
 * at all, so every rule below also names what it expects to find and fails where that is missing.
