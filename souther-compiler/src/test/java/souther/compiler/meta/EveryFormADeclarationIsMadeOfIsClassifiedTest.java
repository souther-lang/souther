/**
 * Every record a published declaration is made of is one {@link DeclarationAgreement} has decided
 * about.
 *
 * <p>The comparison walks a form's components when it has nothing else to say about it, which is
 * right for a form of the grammar and is a default for everything else. A record the compiler puts
 * beside a declaration to say something about itself — which pass rewrote a node, what a coverage
 * point was numbered as — joins the comparison the day it is added, and two builds that mean the
 * same thing start disagreeing over it. Nothing says so: the language still compiles, every test
 * still passes, and what changed is what two builds are held to.
 *
 * <p>So the walk is required to be a decision. A record reachable from a declaration is a form of
 * the grammar, or it is one the comparison names and says how to hold, or it is erased because a
 * value cannot be read differently by it. There is no fourth, and this is what refuses one.
 *
 * <p>Static, over what a declaration can reach rather than over what some fixture happened to build.
 * A form in a corner of the grammar no test writes would otherwise sit there until an author used
 * it, and be answered about then by nobody.
