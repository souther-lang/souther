/**
 * What may be claimed of a run, given what a run's record can hold.
 *
 * <p>A record says which places a run passed. It does not say how many times it passed each, so
 * nothing read off one can tell two facts about a place a run came back to from two facts about a
 * place it passed once. A group says more than that: that these decisions were settled these ways
 * and were consumed into one value together — which is about one passing, and about their outcomes
 * being that passing's.
 *
 * <p>So a group is offered only where a run passes the meeting once. Today nothing forms one
 * anywhere else, because the reading does not go inside a function value at all; that is how the
 * property is met and is not the property. Stated the other way round, a reading that started going
 * in there would quietly begin offering rows for combinations nothing could ever be shown to sit in.
