 * <p>Which behaviors have anything said about their positions was worked out twice. The page left
 * the two lines out where the lists beside the measures were all empty; the document left the object
 * out where the boundary the positions come off was not derived. Neither read the measures. So one
 * compilation answered a reader two ways: a {@code >->} composition wrote {@code no_subject} into
 * the document and nothing onto the page, and a behavior bounded only on a {@code Decimal} wrote
 * that its rules draw no line into one and nothing into the other (issue #1079).
 *
 * <p>Measured over a module holding every shape that decides it, because the two rules agreed on
 * most of them: a model with one shape passes against either rule and says nothing about the pair.
