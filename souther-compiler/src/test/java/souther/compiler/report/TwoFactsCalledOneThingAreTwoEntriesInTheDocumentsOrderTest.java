/**
 * What a document writes about a model two of whose sources were not read, written out.
 *
 * <p>Two sources nothing was observed from are two facts. They are the same word about the same
 * kind of thing, and what tells them apart is which source — which both arrays of this document now
 * say. One of them did not: its entries carried the word and nothing about what the word was said
 * of, so a reader was told how many things held the verdict open and none of what they were.
 *
 * <p><b>What is asked here is the wiring and not the order.</b> That an order is a total one over
 * what a document writes is asked of the order, over every sequence its members could be met in;
 * this asks that the document's arrays go through it at all, over data a compiler produced rather
 * than data a test built. A renderer that walked the account directly would answer this correctly
 * on a model whose facts are met in one order, which is every model with one such source — so the
 * model here has two.
 *
 * <p><b>And that the two arrays disagree on purpose.</b> They no longer disagree about telling two
 * facts apart, and that is the change: what they disagree about is what they count. {@code
 * keptOpenBy} counts facts, so two facts one word covers are two entries and neither is folded
 * away; {@code incompleteness} counts kinds per module. A change that folded either onto the
 * other's unit would pass one half of this and fail the other.
