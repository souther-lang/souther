/**

 * reads the disposition; this read the coverage under it. Three of the four ways an obligation is
 * undecided leave the coverage with nothing to have gone without, so a point nothing could show a
 * row for held a verdict open and named nothing.
 *
 * <p>The same defect the conformance corpus found on the measurement side, one list along. It is
 * held here as a law over the seal rather than as a model: which ways there are is
 * {@link ObligationDisposition.Uncertainty}'s own answer, and a fourth added later arrives here
 * whether or not anybody remembered to write a model for it.
