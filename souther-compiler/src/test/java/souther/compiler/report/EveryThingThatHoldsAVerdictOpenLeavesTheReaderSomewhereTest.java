/**
 * Everything holding a verdict open leaves a reader somewhere, and somewhere it can act.

 * <p>The question a reader of {@code undetermined} has is what to do next, and until now the report
 * answered it only where the answer was a row. What is held here is the other half: every entry
 * reaches exactly one {@link ReaderDisposition}, and which one follows from what the compiler
 * established rather than from a formatter's reading of the words.
 *
 * <p><b>Over the models this repository carries and not over values a test built.</b> A
 * disposition worked out from a hand-made opening says the switch is total, which javac already
 * says; what it does not say is that the openings a real model produces reach the arms anybody
 * expected. Those are two claims and only the second can go wrong quietly.
