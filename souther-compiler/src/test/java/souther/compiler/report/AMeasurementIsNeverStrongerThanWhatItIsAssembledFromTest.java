/**
 * No {@code status} in a document stands over a weaker one beneath it.

 * <p>Read off the document and not off the code that writes it. What each measure answered and what

 * they can be — a check written from the same method that assembles them would agree with whatever
 * that method did, including agreeing with it being wrong.
 *
 * <p>It was wrong. The measures gained an answer of their own about how much of their reading was
 * made, the verdict was moved onto it, and the line above them went on being assembled from the
 * entries — so a behavior whose two measures both said {@code partial} was published under
 * {@code complete}, in a corpus document checked in as the answer.
 *
 * <p>Only {@code complete} against {@code partial}. What {@code unavailable} means takes the reason
 * beside it — a measure nobody asked for and one that could not read what it needed write the same
 * word — and this document is what a consumer holds, so a check here reads what a consumer can.
