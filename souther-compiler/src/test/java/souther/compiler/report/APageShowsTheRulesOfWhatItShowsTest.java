/**
 * A page shows the rules of what it shows, and knows about no others.
 *
 * <p>Where a report sends a reader for a rule with no name is worked out when the report is
 * assembled, and kept beside the account it is about. Which account that is, is the question this
 * holds: a page is about one behavior, so the rules it may send a reader to are that behavior's.
 *
 * <p><b>What it costs to get this wrong is not an extra entry.</b> A page is a value, so a place
 * gathered from a behavior the page does not show is a place that moves when that behavior's source
 * moves — and a report narrowed to the page then changes for an edit to something nobody reading it
 * can see. Which is the shape this whole change is about, arriving at the boundary a filtered report
 * is taken at.

     * Two behaviors with a rule each, and the second written after the first — so a declaration

     *
     * <p>The second's rule is one this compiler does not read to the end, so what a report says
     * about it is a finding about the rule and a sentence sending a reader to it. A pair of rules
     * that both come to lines says nothing here: what a page gathers from a line is already its
     * own, and the entry a page could take from another is the one a finding brings.
