/**
 * The adequacy report writes fixed-width columns, and a name written in Japanese takes twice the
 * room its characters suggest. Held from the caller rather than from the padding, because the
 * padding has a test of its own and would keep passing if the report went back to a format string:
 * a field width is applied inside the formatter, after the name is in its hands, and counts UTF-16
 * units there.
 *
 * <p>What is asserted is where the next field starts. That is the thing a reader sees and the thing
 * the two models have to agree about — a report is a table only if the column is in one place.
