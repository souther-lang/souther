/**

 * asks whether the words agree — a complete whole over a partial part is a contradiction — and a
 * whole that kept its own word while dropping a part's account of why passes it: both say
 * {@code partial}, and the fact that made one of them so is gone. The word was never the point.
 *
 * <p>So this asks the union. A parent's weakening is the union of its parts' and nothing else, which
 * is the whole of the arithmetic #953 replaced a lattice with, and the one property that makes the
 * arithmetic worth having: a fact reaching a whole by any path arrives, and a producer that forgets
 * to hand one over is a whole that is short of it.
 *
 * <p>Held over the values rather than over the document, because the document is where a fact can go
 * missing without anything else moving. The projection is checked where it is written
 * ({@code AMeasureWeakerThanCompleteSaysWhatMadeItSo}); this is about what it is given.
