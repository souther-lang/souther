/**
 * A verdict of {@code undetermined} says whether measuring again with more would answer any of it.
 *
 * <p>The model here is issue #1196's: a behavior that forks on a list computed from its input.
 * Every class of the position is derived and every one of them is covered, both arms are reached,
 * both outputs are specified — and the measure stays partial, because the comparison inside
 * {@code List.isEmpty} is about a value made from the position and nothing works out what it says
 * about the values there.
 *
 * <p>Nothing anybody writes closes that, and nothing any allowance changes either. Before this, the
 * report said {@code undetermined} and stopped, which is the same word it says over a row that did
 * not come back and a space too large to walk — so a person was left to work out for themselves
 * that measuring again would find exactly the same thing.
