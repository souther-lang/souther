 * Every kind of subject is written the way the shipped schema says one is written.
 *
 * <p>The schema tells a consumer what it can read for each kind, and it does that with a branch per
 * kind. Only some of those branches are ever true over the models this repository carries: no model
 * here holds a verdict open on a row that did not come back, on one of a behavior's inputs, or on
 * this compiler's own proof. A schema whose branch nothing reaches is a contract nothing has been
 * held to, and this repository has shipped one of those before — nine versions of a condition that
 * was never once true.
 *
 * <p>So the kinds are built here and written. What is held is not that a model produces them, which
 * is the corpus's business and is asked where the corpus is; it is that what this compiler writes
 * for each kind is what it says it writes.
