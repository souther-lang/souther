 * takes the handle a reader is given and the identity beside it having come from the same rule all
 * the way through.
 *
 * <p>Written because nothing in the fixtures produced such an entry. A word that is wrong for a kind
 * of rule no checked-in document holds is wrong where nobody is looking, and the first reader to
