 * A block prints how many of the obligations it counts a row is at, and everything the difference

 *
 * <p>What a reader does with the report is walk from a number to the work it names, so a number
 * whose difference is unaccounted for is a number nothing can be done about. There are two ways to
 * be counted and not met — a gap, and a point nobody could decide — and they are told apart because
 * what an author does about them differs: one is a row to write, and the other is a question this
 * build could not put.
 *
 * <p>Asked of the report's own model and not of its text. What a block prints is a rendering of the
 * account, and the law is about the account: a gap carries exactly one finding, a point left
 * undecided carries none, and both are named. The last is asked of the text, because being named is
 * what the text does.
 *
 * <p>Every arm is populated before anything is asserted about it. A law over three states two of
 * which no source reaches is a law that passes by not applying, and the counts below are what says
 * it does apply.
