/**
 * A sentence about a reason is a claim about every place that writes it.
 *
 * <p>Turning the codes into sentences is how the report stops handing a reader an enum's name. It
 * is also how a reader gets told what happened on the authority of a name that may be wider than
 * the sentence — which is the defect this whole change is about, made once more one level up. So a
 * code is written out in words only where its producers have been read.
 *
 * <p>The subject is the part of a sentence that is not written here. A reason names what it is about
 * as an identity, and for a source that is whatever the compile was handed it as — a position in a
 * list under a build. What to call it is the caller's answer and arrives with the request, so what
 * these hold is that the words come from the code and the subject comes from the caller.
