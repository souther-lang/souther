/**
 * What a report may name about the arms turns on what was observed of each arm, not on what the
 * measure over all of them came to.
 *
 * <p>The measure here is short of something and every arm of it is answered for: the rows were all
 * read, so the arm no row goes through is a gap and is named, and the fork whose rule could not be
 * worked out takes its own arms out of the count and is said under it. Read as one word, a build
 * whose rows all ran was told a row was not read, and every arm it certainly does not reach went
 * unsaid.
