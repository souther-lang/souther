/**
 * Every surface that says what a module could not read says them in the one order.
 *
 * <p>Three of them publish these facts: the document a build reads, the page a person reads, and
 * the block a generator writes. An order put on one is an order on one, and the other two go on
 * saying whatever the account was iterated in — which is the shape this went wrong in once.
 *
 * <p><b>What this can ask and what it cannot.</b> That two runs of this compiler write one document
 * is what an order being written down is for, and no test inside one run can ask it: a set built by
 * {@code Set.copyOf} iterates by a salt fixed once per process, so two answers in one run agree
 * whatever is wrong. What is asked here is the property that gives that one — that the surfaces
 * take their sequence from the same place — by holding the page against the document. A surface put
 * back on the account itself is then caught in whichever runs the salt disagrees with the written
 * order, which is most of them and not all.
