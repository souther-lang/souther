/**
 * A finding about something a row is owed for names it the way its account names it.
 *
 * <p>What a consumer does with a finding is act on the thing it is about, which means finding that
 * thing in the account the numbers are counted in. The words a reader is shown do not do it: two
 * points of one line are shown the same words where what differs is the run beside the line, and two
 * arms are shown the same word at the same place where what differs is the rule a caller handed the
 * fork. So the identity is written, and this holds that it is written wherever the document names
 * such a thing and that it lands on exactly one entry.
 *
 * <p>Asked of the document rather than of the writer. The rule the writer keeps is that a subject
 * carrying an identity says so by its type, which closes the question locally; what that cannot say
 * is that a shape which should carry one does. Here the two ends are compared: every finding of a
 * kind that is about an obligation, against the array that account publishes.
