/**
 * A comparison is written rather than named, so the question it raises is cited by where it is.
 *
 * <p>{@code RuleRef.named} says a guard's rule is never rendered to a reader on its own: there is
 * nothing the author called it, and "the comparison" sends them nowhere. An invariant's clause has a
 * name and is found by it. One string over both would have to spell a place as a name, which is the
 * assumption a report carrying only names was making before a producer without one reached it.
 *
 * <p>Not the reading occurrence either. Where a rule was read is the partition's, and one comparison
 * inside a helper is read once per call — a question the model raised once would then have to pick
 * one of them to show. This is where the author wrote it, which is one however often it is read.
