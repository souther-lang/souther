/**
 * What says a row can be written at a boundary, and what a refusal is not.

 * <p>Three things can say it and one thing cannot. A projection that read every rule of the value
 * proves it; a row already at the value witnesses it; a value built through the module's own decoder
 * witnesses it. The decoder refusing every candidate it tried says nothing — another value of the
 * same edge may build — so a refusal leaves the edge unknown and never closes it.
 *
 * <p>Held here rather than through the report, because the report prints only the two ends of this:
 * a line it counts and a line it says it cannot promise. Which of the three settled a line, and that
 * a refusal settled nothing, are the facts the counting is derived from, and a test that read them
 * off the printed line could not tell a witness from a proof.
