/**
 * What a build is told about a name on an import list that nothing below writes.
 *
 * <p>An import list is the module's statement of what vocabulary it speaks, and it is the part of a
 * model a reader believes without checking — finding out otherwise means searching the file for each
 * name on it. So the check is the reverse of the one that reads an import: not "what does this name
 * mean" but "did anyone say it".
 *
 * <p>Said of a spelling and not of a declaration. What another module declares is reachable qualified
 * whether or not it is imported, so a name used only as {@code Stock.Sku} is a use of the declaration
 * and not of the list entry, which can go.
