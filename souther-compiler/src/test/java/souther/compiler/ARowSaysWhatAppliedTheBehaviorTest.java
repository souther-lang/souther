/**
 * An outcome records what applied the behavior for that row, and what that application is measured
 * in. Today there is one answerer — the bytecode this compile generated, applied through the loader
 * the run builds — so the answer is the same for every row a compile ran, and this holds it to that
 * while it is still true. What makes the field worth having before a second answerer exists is that
 * it is checkable now: when one arrives, the rows that name it are the ones that changed.
 *
 * <p>What the row cost is the other half of the same record and a different question. A row's
 * evaluation is not only its application: the fixtures are built first and apply whatever helpers
 * they name, so counted points are spent before the behavior is reached and by rows that never reach
 * it. The count is therefore held to the row and not to the application, and what says whether the
 * application itself was code this compile counted is the applier.
 *
 * <p>Which of the two a row is comes from the stage it reached, and the outcome refuses to be built
 * saying otherwise: the two are written from one evaluation and read apart, so a row that says it
 * applied the behavior and says nothing applied it is a state no reader should have to resolve.
