/**
 * A sum every one of whose cases is a unit data is ordered by the order its cases are declared —
 * the order a deal moves through its stages, which nothing else in the model carries. This is what
 * F# gives a discriminated union, Haskell a derived {@code Ord}, Rust a derived {@code Ord} over
 * variants, and Java an enum's ordinal; Elm is the one language that withholds it, and withholding
 * it is why a report has to project the cases onto {@code Int} by hand (issue #161).
