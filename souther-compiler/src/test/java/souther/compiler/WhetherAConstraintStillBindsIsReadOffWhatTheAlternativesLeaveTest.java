/**
 * Whether a branch's constraint still binds under a choice is read off what the alternatives leave.
 *
 * <p>Two alternatives holding a position to the same values hold it there whether or not either of
 * them could be read to the end: the choice is one of them, and both of them say the same thing.
 * So a clause a reading has no word for, written beside a constraint, does not decide what the
 * constraint comes to — and the report says the same about a rule however much of the clause beside
 * it this compiler happens to understand today.
 *
 * <p><b>Both directions, because one of them alone is met by saying nothing.</b> Where the
 * alternatives really do leave the position differently, the unread one is why the choice is as
 * wide as it is and the rule is not reported as one that drew no line. A reading that opened
 * nothing would pass the first half of this and publish a finding about a rule that holds nothing
 * down.
