/**
 * A row's written description is its name, and a name is what something outside the file uses to say
 * which row it means. Two rows of one behavior carrying one name leave that unanswerable, and the
 * failure it would produce is the silent one: a reader keys on the name, finds one of the two, and
 * nothing says the other was meant.
 *
 * <p>So the name is held to being unique among the rows of one behavior, over everything that writes
 * that behavior's rows — the module's own source and every {@code examples for} file attached to it.
 * Both rows of a collision are reported, each in the source it is written in. Which of them is "the
 * duplicate" is not a question the language answers: source order is what a caller hands the compiler
 * (a build sorts its files, a command line does not), so a rule that named one of the two would say
 * different things about one model depending on how the compile was started.
 *
 * <p>A row written without a name is not compared with anything. It cannot be keyed from outside, and
 * that is the whole of what being unnamed means here.
