/**
 * A point this compiler declined to compose a value for is a point the model still owes a row at.
 *
 * <p>What the account is for is telling an author what the model owes. A budget of this compiler's
 * is not the model saying anything: the row it declined to build may be the easiest one in the file
 * to write by hand, and an obligation that leaves the count over it is this compiler's own policy
 * printed as a fact about what somebody wrote.
 *
 * <p><b>The same rule reached by two different figures.</b> One model asks for a collection of a
 * given length and one asks for a total spread over elements that hold at most one, and they stop at
 * two different budgets in two different stages. Held against one of them, closing the other would
 * be a separate piece of work nobody could see was missing.
 *
 * <p>And read as a count that does not move. What a strict build refuses over changes with the
 * number in the model, which is the model's own business; how many rows it owes does not.
