/**
 * A row a search composed for something answers that something when it is read back.
 *
 * <p>The two are separate walks over one model — a search that composes a value at a line, and a
 * reading that asks where a row's values sit — and they have to agree. Where they do not, one of
 * them is wrong about the model and neither says which: a reduction acting on the second would drop
 * a row the first had just written, and the item it was for would go out with nothing offering it.
 *
 * <p><b>A line a declaration owns is the case worth writing down.</b> A behavior's account holds the
 * lines that behavior is owed a row at, and a declaration's lines are none of them — so a reading
 * that looked only there found no reading of a declared line anywhere, and answered that no row
 * stands at one, of rows composed to stand at exactly that.
