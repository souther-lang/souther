/**
 * A rule stating an end past the end of an order, said by whichever reading is its only one.
 *
 * <p>Such a rule is read: what it says is that nothing satisfies it. Where the declaration is
 * refused for that, this report is never produced, and naming the rule here as one nothing could
 * read would send an author after a bound the compiler understood perfectly.
 *
 * <p>Where nothing refuses it, this report is its only reader. A size is that case: the reading that
 * refuses a declaration for holding no value is over the positions a value has, and a size is a
 * number taken of one, so no end of a size reaches it. Silence here would leave the rule unsaid
 * everywhere — which is what a reading justified by "something else refuses this" costs when the
 * justification is borrowed by a caller it is not true of.
