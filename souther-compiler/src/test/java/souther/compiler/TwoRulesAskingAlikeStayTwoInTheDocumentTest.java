/**
 * Two rules asking the same question of the same position stay two in the document.
 *
 * <p>Asked of the document and not of the value behind it, because that is where every round of this
 * has gone wrong: the type was right and the seam it crossed was narrower. The rule reached
 * {@code PartitionEvidence} and the writer published the words for finding it; then it reached the
 * finding's arguments and that writer did not ask for it either.
 *
 * <p>Two arms of one {@code ensures} clause may name the same case, which {@code RuleRef.Ensures}
 * says outright — the author's words for them are the same words. So the handle cannot tell them
 * apart, and the identity beside it is what does. Both surfaces are asked here, and so is the part
 * of an identity that is easiest to leave out: two modules may each declare an {@code Amount}, and a
 * projection written without the module maps two rules onto one.
