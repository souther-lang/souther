/**
 * A partition of a position is what the model treats alike, and not what this compiler can name.
 *
 * <p>{@code 3 * d <= 1} tells 0.3 from 0.34: the behavior answers one way for one and the other way
 * for the other, so the position has two classes. What it does not have is a number to name the line
 * by — a third is no decimal this language writes — and a measure that counted the classes it could
 * write a boundary for would be reporting how far this compiler's own numbers reach rather than what
 * the model distinguishes. Which is the confusion #880 is about, one level in.
 *
 * <p>Naming them is a separate question with a separate answer. Where the line falls on a value of
 * the position, the classes are named by that value as they always were; where it does not, they are
 * named by the rule that drew it. What tells two classes apart is neither of those spellings: two
 * rules that divide a position in one place make one division however they were written.
