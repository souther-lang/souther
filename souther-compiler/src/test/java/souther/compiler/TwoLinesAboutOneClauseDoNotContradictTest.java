/**
 * Two lines about one clause do not contradict each other.
 *
 * <p>Issue #842, at the surface it was found on. A bounded numeric newtype divided by a {@code
 * guard} printed both of these, four rows apart:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     partition   axes 1   equivalence partitions 2/2
 *       · read in part: length (a rule about it is one this compiler did not read)
 *     border      2/4
 *       ! no row is at the ON point price/length = 1 (invariant Length (min))
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>The clause the first line said had gone unread is the clause the second draws its line from,
 * named. Both were true of different questions and neither said which question it was about: the
 * first was written off the reading that turns clauses into sets of values, which has no word for a
 * range and is short of the rules at every position an invariant bounds, and the second off the
 * reading that turns the same clause into an end and had it whole.
 *
 * <p>What settles it is asking the model rather than a reading. The question a rule raises is
 * answered by whichever reading took the rule in, and both of these rules were taken in — so there
 * is nothing to say about them, and the line is gone rather than reworded.
