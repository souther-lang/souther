/**
 * Whether anything applies a behavior for a row is what the run's answerer says, and not how the
 * behavior is written.
 *
 * <p>The two say the same thing while a compile's own classes are the only thing that applies
 * anything, so either could be read for the other without being wrong. They are different questions
 * all the same, and each test here is one of the ways they come apart:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>a behavior written with no {@code let} that something applies — the row runs;</li>
 *   <li>a behavior written with a body that nothing applies — the row is recorded;</li>
 *   <li>a behavior something has an implementation for that cannot be reached — a failure, and not
 *       a row nothing applies.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The third is the one that says why this is answered rather than derived from what a loader
 * holds. An implementation that is not where it was looked for is this compiler failing to reach
 * what it undertook to apply, and answering that with "nothing applies this behavior" would record a
 * broken compile as a model waiting for a {@code let}.
