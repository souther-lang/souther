/**
 * A run does not hand a row to an answer whose declarations are of another build of the module.
 *
 * <p>What the row's values are is decided by the module being evaluated, and what reads them is
 * decided by whatever the answer was compiled against. Where those are two builds, a row handed over
 * is decided by a disagreement between the builds rather than by the model: an invariant that has
 * been narrowed refuses a value the model admits, a case added to a union arrives at an answer that
 * has no such case. Both land somewhere that reads as a statement about the model.
 *
 * <p>So the row stops before it is handed over, and stops saying what it is: everything it can be
 * held to without being run has been, and what it could not be is run against something nobody could
 * establish. That is an absence of evidence and not a failing row.
