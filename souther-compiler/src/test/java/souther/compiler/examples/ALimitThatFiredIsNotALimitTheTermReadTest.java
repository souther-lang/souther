/**
 * A limit that fired is not a limit the term read, and the two are joined here.
 *
 * <p>Whether an observation stopped and whether the number a rule is about was one of the things it
 * stopped at are different facts. A count taken at a container's root survives a walk that ran out
 * of nodes inside it — the elements arrive stopped and there are still as many of them — so a walk
 * under a budget and a reading that met the budget do not follow from one another.
 *
 * <p>Which is why the two halves are joined by a value and not by argument. Above this, a producer
 * test holds that each budget stops a walk; below it, a reading test holds that a stopped value
 * never reads as a row that does not stand. Neither says that what the first produces arrives where
 * the second is asked, and a model was met that crossed a budget by two thousand nodes and read
 * back a perfectly good number.
 *
 * <p>Under limits of its own, so the join is a few values wide rather than a compilation deep. What
 * is being held is the path from a walk to a term, and the numbers a shipped observation happens to
 * use are not part of it.
