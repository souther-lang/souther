/**
 * The walk that stops and the predicate that judges say the same thing about one value.
 *
 * <p>Two readings of one set of numbers. {@code ObservedValues} reads a live value under limits and
 * says where it stopped; {@link Limits#admits} is asked of a value already read whole and says
 * whether those numbers would have kept it. Nothing holds them to each other but this: they count
 * the same things, and a value that stands at a bound has to be kept by one exactly where it is
 * admitted by the other.
 *
 * <p>Why it matters that they agree. What a row states is read whole, because a comparison is made
 * against what was written and not against as much of it as fits; what a row's inputs are is read
 * under the limits, because an answer holds them for as long as it is memoised. So one row's two
 * halves reach the same question by the two routes, and a row whose input was dropped while an
 * expectation of the same size was kept would be saying that one value is two sizes.
