/**

 * <p>ADR-0088 made such a row a record of what the behavior owes: its arity is checked, its inputs
 * are built through their derived decoders and held to their invariants, its expectation is held to
 * the output's cases, and there it stops as {@code PENDING}. What is held here is the other half —
 * the row deciding whether the implementation answers what the model says it owes.
 *
 * <p>The implementation is compiled by {@code javac} against the module's classes written to a
 * directory, and loaded from that directory. That is the position a real one is in and not a
 * simulation of it: it extends a base of a build that is not this run's, its classes are its own
 * loader's, and nothing of this compile's may be handed to it. An implementation given this run's
 * own values fails on the first cast inside itself.
