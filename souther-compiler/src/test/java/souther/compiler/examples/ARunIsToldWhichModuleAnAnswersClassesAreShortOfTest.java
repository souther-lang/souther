 *
 * <p>The plainest way an answer's classes come up short, and the one nothing said anything about.
 * They carry the module being evaluated and not the module its import line names, so the module
 * cannot be read here — and every way a reading stops came out as one sentence, that what was
 * published cannot be read by this compiler. There was a module to put where those classes are read
 * from, and nothing named it.
 *
 * <p>What is held is the whole of what a reader is told, and not only that the reason survived as a
 * value. Three things reach the row: whose declarations could not be read, why they could not, and
 * what there is to do about it — and the last is the one that turns on this. Classes short of a
 * module are classes short of something, and the artifact naming it is not at fault; classes
 * carrying something wrong are, and telling somebody to rebuild the first is sending them to fix
 * what was never broken.
