/**
 * What stands in for a behavior's requirement while an example runs, and where that was found.
 *
 * <p>Two things may stand in — a {@code with} written on the row, and a {@code fake} table written
 * beside it — and the row is looked at first. That order, and the fact that there are two of them at
 * all, is what E1908 is about: a row whose target depends on something neither supplies cannot run,
 * and the message says both ways to answer it.
 *
 * <p>It lived inside the verifier, wound together with building the value each stand-in answers
 * with. A reader that only wants to know whether a requirement is still owed — an editor offering to
 * write a row, which cannot build a value because it has none yet — had nowhere to ask, and asking
 * by looking for a {@code with} and then a {@code fake} itself would be this rule written a second
 * time.
 *
 * <p>The answer carries what it found rather than a yes or no, because the two callers do different
 * things with it: one builds a stand-in out of it, the other counts what is left.
