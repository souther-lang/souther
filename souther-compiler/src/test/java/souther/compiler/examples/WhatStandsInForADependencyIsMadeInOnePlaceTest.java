 * of the loader the implementation came from, and the values the row states, which are of nothing.
 * They are the same text read once — the helpers a stand-in names are applied where it is built, and
 * a second reading applies them again — so both come out of one place, and this says which.
 *
 * <p>Read off the class files rather than the source. A call is in the caller's constant pool

 * it, so a second reading cannot get out of this by being written somewhere shorter.
