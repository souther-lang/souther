/**
 * What applies a behavior is asked in two steps, and which of them a row got through is what its
 * outcome says about it.
 *
 * <p>Making a stand-in into something the behavior can be constructed with is building the environment
 * the behavior runs in. A row that could not get one never entered the behavior, and says so: it stops
 * where a row whose dependency has nothing standing in for it stops, and nothing applied it. A row
 * that did get one and then met a failure entered the behavior, and says that instead.
 *
 * <p>Held here because the two steps are what keeps that true. Asked as one call, a stand-in that could
 * not be made would be found after the row had already been recorded as having entered the behavior,
 * and every reader of the outcome would be told a row ran that never did.
