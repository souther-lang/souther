/**
 * Whichever of an observation's budgets runs out, what the walk hands back is the same word.
 *
 * <p>There are four numbers and one thing they do. A walk that goes too deep, one that has held too
 * many nodes, one at a collection longer than it keeps and one at a text longer than it keeps all
 * stop, and what stands where the value would have been says that a limit stopped there — not which
 * limit, and nothing about the value. So a reading written for one of them is a reading for all
 * four, and this is what says so.
 *
 * <p><b>Each number with its two neighbours.</b> A budget tested with a value well past it passes
 * for a walk that stops one early or one late, and one early is a value the report says nothing can
 * be read of when it plainly can. So each of these is the largest value the budget keeps and the
 * smallest it does not.
 *
 * <p>Held here rather than by a model apiece. What a rule downstream does with the word is the
 * reading's own law and is held where the reading is; four models saying it again would be the same
 * law written four times, at the cost of a compilation each and with three of them measuring
 * whichever budget the model happened to cross first.
