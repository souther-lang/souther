/**
 * A comparison no run answers through is not a rule the model has no line for.
 *
 * <p>Its outcome is about no row, because the expression it decides never answers a value — so
 * there is nothing for a report to say of it, and in particular nothing in the words a reading of
 * the arithmetic answers in. Those words are about what the arithmetic could do with the form, and
 * the form is not what refuses the comparison: where it stands is. Given a reason in those words all
 * the same, a comparison the arithmetic reads to the end is reported as one whose form went unread,
 * and the measurement is marked short of something no reader fell short of.
 *
 * <p>What refuses it is asked of the standing, so the claim is made at both levels: that this
 * comparison is one the policy refuses for that reason, and that the report says nothing of it.
 * Without the first, the second would hold of a model whose comparison was simply a line. And the
 * silence is shown to be the right answer rather than a missing one: the case the comparison stands
 * in is reported as one the model rules out, and everything the model does answer by is measured
 * whole.
