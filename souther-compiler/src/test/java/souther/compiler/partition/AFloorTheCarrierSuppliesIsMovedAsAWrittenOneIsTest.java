/**
 * A floor the carrier supplies and a floor a clause wrote are moved by one mechanism.
 *
 * <p>A length is never negative and nothing writes that down, so {@code String.length(value) /= 0}
 * takes the nought off a floor nobody wrote and the position starts at one. A written floor with
 * the same value taken off it comes to the same place. Neither is named in the rule that moves it:
 * what they have in common is being in what the other rules leave, and that is where the rule is
 * read against.
 *
 * <p>Two things are asked of each model and neither settles the other. What the rules leave the
 * position is the geometry; what is owed for it is the authored lines that account for where the
 * values stop. Two models leaving the same range may owe different lines, and two models writing
 * different numbers of clauses may owe the same — a clause restating what the carrier already
 * states holds nothing, and one whose end a tighter one covers owes nothing either, as before.
 *
 * <p>Both directions are held here. Read as "the same range means the same obligations", a check
 * would let a debt be folded away the day two ranges agreed; read as "different clauses mean
 * different obligations", it would demand a row for a clause that accounts for nothing.
