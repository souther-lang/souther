/**

 *
 * <p>A bound was read off the newtype chain of the position's own type and off nothing else, so the
 * same rule was measured or unmeasured according to where the author happened to write it.
 * {@code data Cart = List<Int> invariant List.length(value) >= 1} drew a line at 1 and
 * {@code data Cart = { lines: List<OrderLine> } invariant List.length(lines) >= 1} drew none — and an
 * aggregate with a second field has no choice but the second spelling. The measure rewarded wrapping
 * every constrained field in a newtype of its own, which is a modelling choice and says nothing about
 * the rule being stated (#649).
 *
 * <p>What the older rule protected is the relational case, and that is what the negative half here is
 * for. A clause relating two coordinates still divides neither and still places nothing: taking a
 * range in is not the same act as putting an edge in it, and a position whose only limit is another
 * position's is one the model draws no line through.
