/**
 * A number an operation takes over a run of values is measured without any position answering it.
 *
 * <p>What the machinery around a border wants of a number is that it can be read off a row and that
 * its values are ordered. Neither wants a place, and this holds that: the run is written by hand
 * here, so what is being tested is the reading and the quantity rather than the walk that finds one
 * in a body.
 *
 * <p>What it must not gain is a position. Two lines of sixty and forty stand on the boundary of a
 * hundred as surely as one of a hundred does, so a class at the place the values are read from
 * would be a class about a rule no model states — which is why this term has no position at all
 * and every reader that would draw one cannot be handed it.
