/**
 * Four questions are asked of one shape, and they are four.
 *
 * <p>What is readable off a value standing here, what a value here is composed out of, which
 * positions a reading has under it, and what a written value has under a step. At a record all four
 * come to the same fields, which is close enough to take one of them for all four; at a sum whose
 * cases share a spread only the first has anything to say, because those names are readable at every
 * value of the sum and a value there is one of the cases.
 *
 * <p><b>The agreement at a record is what is checked, not what is implemented.</b> Each of the four
 * reads {@code Shape.Product}'s fields where it needs them, and the four answers are held together
 * here rather than by one of them being the others' answer. Written the other way round, a question
 * that learned a new case would take the three it does not own along with it.
 *
 * <p><b>Four and not five.</b> How an observed value is read down a path is the relation the written
 * one is most often mistaken for, and it is not one of these: it consumes a value, answers with as
 * many standings as it finds, and can find none, so there is no equality to hold between it and a
 * map of fields. What it owes is stated where it lives
 * ({@link AnObservedValueIsReadByWhatIsReadableAndNotByWhatItCarriesTest}) — that a field is
 * admitted by what is readable at the position and never by what the value in hand carries.
