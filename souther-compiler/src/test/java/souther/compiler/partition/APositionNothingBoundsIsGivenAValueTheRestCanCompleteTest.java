/**
 * A position nothing bounds is given a value the positions after it can finish, not one that merely
 * sits inside what they can reach.
 *
 * <p>A search bounds each position by what the rest can still add up to and enumerates it between
 * those ends. A position nothing bounds has no ends to run between, so one value is taken and the
 * walk goes on — and which value that is used to be settled by the reach alone. The reach is an
 * interval and the question is not: {@code 3a + 6b = 3} asks that {@code 3 - 3a} be a multiple of
 * six, which is {@code a} odd, and the value an unbounded range gives up is zero.
 *
 * <p>The same arithmetic was already written down as a pruning. Applied to a residue after a
 * position had been chosen it can only reject, and where a position offers one candidate there is
 * nothing for a rejection to leave.
 *
 * <p>Both kinds of position, because the arithmetic differs and only one of them counts. Over whole
 * numbers what a position is held to is an arithmetic progression. Over decimals it is dense and
 * still not every value — a third is not a decimal a model writes — so a coset there names a value
 * and has no next one.
