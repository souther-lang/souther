/**
 * Which counts a carrier holds is the carrier's to say, and every producer of an end asks it.
 *
 * <p>A strict comparison over a carrier that steps is sharpened onto the count beside the one it
 * names: {@code value > 5} is an end at 6. Where the carrier has no count there, there is no end to
 * record — and the reader that sharpens it had its own idea of where counts stop, the range of a
 * {@code long}, which is a fact about one carrier out of five.
 *
 * <p>What that cost: {@code value > Won} sharpened to the place after the last case, which is inside
 * a {@code long} and outside the enumeration. The end became a cut, the cut an obligation, and the
 * obligation was asked for the value it stands for — a case at a place that has none. A `Date` past
 * the last day the calendar has does the same and did so before any of this.
 *
 * <p>The other half of the same rule is that holding a count is a question and not a correction. A
 * date-time's counts sit on a grid at the nanosecond, and what writes one rounds onto that grid — so
 * a reader that asked whether a carrier holds a count and was handed the nearest one it does hold
 * would offer a value between two moments as one of them.
