/**

 *
 * <p>A rule was read and could not be used, and the reader that read it knows which rule; or the
 * reading never arrived at the rules of a position, and there is no rule to name because none was
 * observed. Written as one shape with the rule left out where there is none, a consumer would have
 * to read an absent field to know which of the two it was holding — and a report would name a rule
 * for some entries and not the rest with nothing saying why.
 *
 * <p>Both are told under {@code PARTITION_NOT_READ}, and the reason beside each says which limit
 * it is waiting on. {@code PARTITION_RULES_NOT_REACHED} belongs to the finding about a position the
 * axes did measure, which is a different thing to act on and writes the same one field.
