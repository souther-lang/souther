/**
 * What a class comes to when the values the model states ran out of room.
 *
 * <p>A class is looked for against every value the model states, each walked outward from the
 * target alone, and that walk is bounded. Behind the same bound sat the row composed from the
 * classes, which is not one of those values: where it stands is where the classes put it, and the
 * classes are what the search itself named. So it was not competing with the stated values for
 * their budget, and a model that stated enough of them took away the one row that needed none.
 *
 * <p>What the reader was handed instead was the search saying it had stopped, over a class the
 * model can hold a row for. That is a claim about the model made on the strength of a limit: it
 * sends a person looking for a rule to change where what they have is a row somebody can write in
 * a line.
 *
 * <p>The bound still says what it says. A walk that ran out of assignments and one that ran out of
 * budget are different facts about the search, and the second is what {@code SEARCH_LIMIT} is for —
 * it decides the class's answer where nothing else could be written for it, rather than in front of
 * the composition.
