/**
 * "The model divides this position no way" is the end of a chain, not a value anything can write.
 *
 * <p>It was a value anything could write, and everything that could not answer wrote it: a walk
 * that fell out of the bottom of a chain of conditions, a reader that stopped at a name, a rule
 * nothing could turn into a line. What all of those have in common is that they say something about
 * this compiler, and the sentence they produced says something about the model.
 *
 * <p>So the chain is the type. A position is read; where the producers of local evidence came back
 * with nothing it becomes a {@link PendingPosition}; and completing one of those with what the
 * rules came to is what produces the absence. It is the one arm where nothing stopped and nothing
 * was found.
 *
 * <p>What is held here is that arm and its neighbours. That nothing outside this package can start
 * the chain halfway through is the visibility of {@link PendingPosition}, which no test in this
 * package can show — the scan below is a tripwire over where the one absence is named, not a proof
 * that it cannot be reached another way.
