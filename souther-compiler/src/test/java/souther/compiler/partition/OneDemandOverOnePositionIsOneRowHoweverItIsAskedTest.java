/**
 * One demand over one position, asked as a class and asked as the way into an arm.
 *
 * <p>These are two questions a reader has and one search. A class is the model dividing a position;
 * an arm is a place in the body, and what it takes to arrive there is what the reading says. What
 * they have in common is the shape of the answer: a row that sits in some classes, written as near
 * as it can be to what the model already states.
 *
 * <p>So a way into an arm that settles one position asks exactly what a class of that position asks,
 * and the row offered is the same row. Where the two searches were written apart, the class's was
 * composed against a value the module states and the arm's against nothing — the same question
 * answered two ways in one block (issue #1034).
 *
 * <p>Asked of every such way the model has rather than of one named here. Which arms a body has and
 * which of them one position settles is the reading's answer, and a test naming a probe would be
 * asserting this of whichever arm a reading happened to number that way.
