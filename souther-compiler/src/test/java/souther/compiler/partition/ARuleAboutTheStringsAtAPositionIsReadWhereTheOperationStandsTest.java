/**
 * What a behavior states about the strings at one of its positions, read off the tree that has it.
 *
 * <p>{@code String.startsWith} is one of the language's own operations. The tree a backend emits has
 * it expanded into the walk it turns into, so a body written full of rules about its strings holds
 * none there — which is where such a rule was being looked for, and why a position an author had
 * written one for admitted every string there is.
 *
 * <p>Three things are held here. That the rule is found at all; that one rule read twice is two
 * readings of one rule, since a helper holding it is expanded at each call and the two divide the
 * position differently; and that a rule nothing reads is no rule, because a class divided off a
 * position by it is one no value of the model is ever on either side of.
