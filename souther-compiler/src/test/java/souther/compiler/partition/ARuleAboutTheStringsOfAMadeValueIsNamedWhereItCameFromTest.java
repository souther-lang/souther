/**
 * A rule an author wrote about the strings of a value an operation made is named at every position
 * that value came from.
 *
 * <p>Not measured there. What {@code String.uppercase} answers is made from what stands at a
 * position and is not those strings, so a line drawn there would be at values the rule is not about.
 * What it must not be is silent: the author wrote a rule, and a reading that placed it nowhere
 * reported a model that states nothing at the position — which is the answer a body with no rule in
 * it gives.
 *
 * <p><b>At every position and not the first.</b> A value joined out of two positions is made out of
 * both, and an author who wrote a rule about the joined string is owed the sentence at each of them.
 * Filed at one, the other comes back as a position the model says nothing about.
 *
 * <p>What the value is made of is {@link souther.compiler.check.ValueOrigin}'s answer, which is the
 * same answer the reading of a comparison beside this one is filed from. Asked of where a subject's
 * value came from instead, a rule about anything an operation stands over is a rule about nothing:
 * that question is answered for a leaf, and an application is not one.
