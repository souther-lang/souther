/**
 * What an optional holds is a position, so what its type says about it is owed and a row is offered
 * for it.
 *
 * <p>Whether an optional holds anything is a narrowing like a sum's case (ADR-0114), so the position
 * under it is {@code tag@Some} and the rules of what it holds are read there. Before that it was
 * nowhere: `Tag?` and `Tag` held the same type, the second was measured against the invariant and
 * the first was reported as rules the walk never reached, and nothing an author could write
 * discharged it — the same boundary was insisted on at one field and owed at neither end of the
 * other (issue #1063).
 *
 * <p><b>Both ends, because each was wrong on its own.</b> The measure has to owe the line, and the
 * generator has to offer a row that stands on it: with the line owed and the requirement dropped on
 * the way to the plan, the row offered for {@code String.length(query.tag@Some) = 1} was
 * {@code tag = None}, which is a row at no point under {@code Some} at all.
