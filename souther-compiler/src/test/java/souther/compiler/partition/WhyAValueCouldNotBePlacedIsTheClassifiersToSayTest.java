/**
 * Why a row could not be placed at a position, and who is entitled to say.
 *
 * <p>A classifier may read through the value it is given: a number at a position is the number
 * inside the newtype named there, because a newtype is not a step in a path. So the value the walk
 * finds and the value a class is about are not always the same node, and only the classifier knows
 * which one it read.
 *
 * <p>Held here because the difference is invisible half the time. A limit reached one wrapper in
 * used to come back as a value that could not be read — right about the row and wrong about what
 * happened to it — while the same failure at the node itself came back correctly, and an unreadable
 * value one wrapper in came back correctly by accident. Which is why nothing noticed.
