/**
 * A rule may name a position the reading of an input has none for, and that is not an error.
 *
 * <p>The walk enumerates what positions a type can have and stops where a path returns to a
 * declaration already open on it, because that question has no other end. Nothing stops a rule from
 * naming what is under that: the reader that turns an expression into a path follows as many steps
 * as are written, and a written path is as long as the author made it. So a term at a path the
 * reading has no position for is an ordinary thing to be handed, and the line drawn on it is
 * measured where the model wrote it.
 *
 * <p>Told apart from a term of some other behavior's input, which is a caller's mistake and is
 * refused as one. Both are "no position of this input is at that path", and only one of them is
 * anybody's fault: a path under a parameter of this input belongs to it however far down it goes,
 * and what is unknown there is what the rules relate it to rather than whose it is.
