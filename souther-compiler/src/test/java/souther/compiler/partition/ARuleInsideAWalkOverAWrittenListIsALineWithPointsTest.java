/**
 * A rule written inside a step a combinator applies per element is a line, with the points a row has
 * to meet it at.
 *
 * <p>How many times a run passes a comparison used to settle this, and what settles it now is the
 * arithmetic. Every atom of a line is a term the row decides — a value at a position, a number taken
 * of one, or a number taken over the occurrences of one path in a single run — so a run through a
 * comparison that bears a line reads what the row holds however many times it passes: at one
 * occurrence of a position where the passes stand at different occurrences of one, and at the same
 * values where they do not.
 *
 * <p>Which is why the first of these is here. Nothing about an element enters its rule at all, and
 * it was refused for standing where an element's rule stands — so it is the case that says what the
 * refusal was costing, with none of the reading of elements in it.
