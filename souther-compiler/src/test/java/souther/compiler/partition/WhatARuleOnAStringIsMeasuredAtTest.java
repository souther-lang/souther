/**
 * Every shape a rule on a string takes, and what each is measured at.
 *
 * <p>Written out rather than left to be inferred, for the reason the carrier table is: a string is
 * the one carrier whose values have a least one and no next one, so what it can give up differs from
 * one end of a range to the other, and a rule that reads right for `+<+` can be silently wrong for
 * `+>+`. A table is what makes that visible — one row differing from its mirror is a question to
 * answer rather than a number to accept.
 *
 * <p>Three numbers per row and not one. The classes are what the rows are measured against, the
 * representatives are what a generated row would carry, and the obligations are what a build refuses
 * over — and a change that gets the first right and the third wrong is a partition nothing has to
 * cover.
 *
 * <p><b>What a string cannot give.</b> Above a value, nothing: every string with that one as a
 * prefix is greater, so a value exists and picking which would put a character nobody wrote into a
 * row somebody has to read. Below one, the empty string, which is the least there is rather than a
 * choice. That asymmetry is the whole of what a string costs, and it is why the rows below are not
 * symmetric and should not be made so.
