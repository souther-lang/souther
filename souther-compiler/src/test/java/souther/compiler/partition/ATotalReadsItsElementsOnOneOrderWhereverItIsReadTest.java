/**
 * A total of a container is added up over its elements, and the elements are read the same way
 * wherever the total is.
 *
 * <p>The values a total is taken of are places of the order the answer is measured on: a walk
 * carries what it has so far in the type it answers, so an element is a place of the same carrier
 * the sum is. The other end is the order the value at the term's own path is written on, and a
 * container is written on none — so a reader taking that end of the pair has nothing to add its
 * elements up with, and the total it answers is no number. Every class of the axis measuring that
 * total then says it does not hold the value, which is the partition's own contract broken: a class
 * holds every value of the position it is a class of.
 *
 * <p>Which is why a row is written here. Measuring the reading alone leaves this unexercised — an
 * axis is made and a border is drawn without any row falling into a class.
