/**
 * A rule written under a denial draws the line the rule states, not the one its operator does.
 *
 * <p>A conjunct that placed no end is handed to this reading, which reads what it compares and what
 * it claims of the two sides. Handed the expression instead, this reading recognised the comparison
 * again off the operator — and the operator of a rule written under a denial states the comparison
 * that holds exactly where the rule does not, so {@code not (lo /= hi)} would draw the line of
 * {@code lo /= hi}: the values it parts are the ones the rule admits.
 *
 * <p>An ordering between two positions, because that is the shape this reading draws a line for. A
 * rule naming a value of the number two positions stand apart parts that number from every other
 * one and keeps no end of it, so a denial exchanged there leaves nothing for a line to be the wrong
 * way round about.
 *
 * <p>Read through to the lines rather than at the hand-over, because the hand-over is not where the
 * two readings could differ — it is where one of them stops and the other starts, and a value
 * carried across correctly and read for the wrong thing is a defect this would not see.
