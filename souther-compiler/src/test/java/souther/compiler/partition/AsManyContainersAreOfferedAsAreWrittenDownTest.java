/**
 * How many containers a total is offered is the figure written down, and what is not offered is said.
 *
 * <p>The budget counts containers. A walk that asked about it while stepping through counts was
 * asking in a place that steps by something else, and a count offering two containers stepped past
 * the figure — so what a caller was handed was the shape of the inner walk rather than what this
 * file says it hands over. Nothing unsound came of it, and that is the point: a limit nobody can
 * read off the constant is a limit that moves when the walk beside it is rearranged.
 *
 * <p>Beside {@link ARowIsComposedForAPointOnATotalTest}, which is about the rows. What a model gets
 * is one row per point, so how many were offered for it to be chosen from is not visible from there
 * at all.
