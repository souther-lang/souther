 * A placement becomes an answer in one place, so that the last step cannot be written per shape.
 *
 * <p>What a search hands back is the same thing whatever it was searching for: one position at a
 * place of its carrier, two of them a distance apart, a form at a level. Each of those searches is
 * written on its own, and each also had to remember to hold what it found against the rules before
 * offering it — a placement inside every range can still be one the rules refuse, and offered as a
 * row it comes back refused where it is built, which a report says as every value having been
 * tried.
 *
 * <p>Two of the three did not remember. They were noticed one at a time, which is what a per-shape
 * obligation costs; the third would have been noticed the day a fourth shape of line was drawn. So
 * the obligation is not per shape: there is one place a placement becomes an answer, and a search
 * that goes round it fails here.
 *
 * <p>Read off the compiled classes, because what is checked is whose code runs the constructor and
 * no way of writing the call can dress that up as something else.

     * a check per shape. Which methods of the owning type derive one is the table's to say: a coset
     * whose values step and one whose values fill are different sets and are answered apart. What
     * the check is for is that nothing outside the type answers at all. What a placement is offered as is one; and what a search may conclude from
     * finding nothing is the other — {@link souther.compiler.partition.CandidateDomain.None} says a
     * position has no value left and {@code One} says it has exactly one, and a walk that comes back
     * empty-handed off either of them is a proof that reaches {@code Impossible}. Derived somewhere
     * else, from a range that could not name a value or from a search that gave up, they would take
     * a coverage item away.
