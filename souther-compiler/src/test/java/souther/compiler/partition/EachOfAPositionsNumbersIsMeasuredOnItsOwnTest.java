/**
 * Each number of a position is measured on its own, and the evidence goes to the number it names.
 *
 * <p>A {@code String} has two — its own order, and how long it is — and a rule is written about one
 * of them. What a rule about the length says is nothing a rule about the order contradicts, so
 * there is no choice to make between them: the position is measured at both, and each measure holds
 * the classes and lines about its own number.
 *
 * <p>Which is what keeps the two vocabularies apart. A class saying the value is {@code "AB"}
 * answers by reading a string; a line at two lies on the order a length is counted on. Brought to
 * one measure, one of them has to be labelled with the other's number, and then a class is asked
 * about a place it was never about.
