/**
 * A condition the composer cannot put a value under is said, and none of its positions is pinned.
 *
 * <p>Two things, and the second is why the first is worth saying. A cut over two positions is one
 * statement about the pair: one of them put where the cut admits while the other keeps whatever the
 * declarations leave is not half the condition holding, it is the condition not holding with a
 * position pinned on the strength of it. So a cut this cannot place every position of is placed at
 * none — and then the fact that it was handed a condition it could not act on is carried out with
 * the answer, because a row composed without it may not arrive and nothing else would say why.
 *
 * <p><b>What a location holds and what is measured there are two things.</b> A row writes one value
 * where a location is, and a location may have more than one number taken at it — the length of a
 * string beside the string. Keyed by the location, the second of them is dropped for the first; and
 * a condition above the line dropped without a word is the composer having been handed the way and
 * quietly not using it.
 *
 * <p>Held here rather than against a model, because what is under test is the rule and not which
 * models happen to reach it. Naming the terms directly says which case is which, where a search for
 * a model that produces one would leave that to be read off the answer.
