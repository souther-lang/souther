/**
 * Two rules read from end to end that draw no line, and they are not the same news.
 *
 * <p>One of them states nothing about the position: {@code a - a > 0} names it and compares a
 * number it does not appear in, so the values there are exactly what they were. The other holds the
 * position to the strings a format accepts, and everything else is refused at construction — so the
 * value written there has to be one of them, which is a fact a reader acts on.
 *
 * <p>Neither is a position the model divides no way, and their verdicts do not tell them apart:
 * what a verdict says is how far the readings got, and these two got equally far. What differs is
 * what the rule did to the position, and the reason is where that lives — so the difference is held
 * there, which is the only place it can be held at all.
 *
 * <p><b>Which is what stops the over-generalisation either way.</b> A reading that gave every rule
 * without a line the word for a restriction would say the model holds down a position it leaves
 * alone; one that gave a restriction the word for a division would say the model tells apart values
 * the declaration refuses to build.
