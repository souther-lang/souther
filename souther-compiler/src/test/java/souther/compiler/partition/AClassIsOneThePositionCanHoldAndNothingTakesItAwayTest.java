 *
 * <p>What a type declares and what a position can hold are separate facts, crossed where the
 * position is read: {@code data StageI = Stage invariant value == Qualified} declares three cases
 * and holds one, and the other two are rows nobody can write (E1903). That crossing was made
 * against the intervals alone, so the same rule written as an ordering took the cases away and the
 * same rule written as an equality did not — which is a partition that turns on how a rule is
 * spelled rather than on what it says.
 *
 * <p>And evidence arriving later refines: a body comparing a position it already has classes for
 * draws a line among them rather than replacing them. Replacement is how a class the model states
 * would come to be lost to a rule the body writes, and the loss reads as the model never having
 * stated it.
