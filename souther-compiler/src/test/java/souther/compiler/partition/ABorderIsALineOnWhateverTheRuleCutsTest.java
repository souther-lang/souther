/**
 * A rule draws a line wherever it cuts something the rows can be measured against, and what it cuts
 * is not always a position.
 *
 * <p>Issue #871. An equivalence partition is defined by conditions that may combine several
 * interacting variables, and each atomic condition defines a border of it (ISTQB CTAL-TA v4.0
 * §3.1.1). Souther drew a line where a rule compared one position against a written value, and where
 * it compared one position against another, and nothing anywhere else — so
 * {@code 300 * straw + 600 * choco <= 4800} drew nothing, and what the report showed instead were the
 * four sides of the box the two positions sit in. That is the case the technique exists for.
 *
 * <p>And the defect was wider than the issue's own title. {@code a + 1 <= 10} is a line at one
 * position, and {@code 2 * a <= 10} is a line on twice one position, and neither was read either:
 * what the readers wanted was a spelling, and what a rule says is arithmetic.
 *
 * <p>Two of these are the design tests rather than examples. {@code 2 * a <= 9} names a threshold the
 * quantity never takes — the even numbers have no nine in them — so a reading that assumed a
 * threshold is one of its quantity's own values puts a row at four and a half. And {@code a > b} over
 * strings has an order and no numbers, so a reading that turned every distance into a count loses it.
 * A border machinery that answers both without a branch for either is one a fourth kind of quantity
 * can be added to.
