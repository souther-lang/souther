/**
 * Where a written value has a part is asked by the one walk that writes values.
 *
 * <p>{@code BehaviorInputs.stepWrittenValue} answers one of the two relations a path step stands
 * for: where a value written at a position has the part a step names. The other is what a value
 * standing there may be read as, and the two are one answer at a record and part at a sum whose
 * cases share a spread — a name every case spreads is readable at the sum and no row writes
 * anything at it.
 *
 * <p>So a reader that wants the second and takes this one reads no value at every name a model
 * reads through a sum. That is what the walk over a row's values did, and nothing said so: the
 * census in {@code NoQuestionAboutAShapeIsAnsweredOutOfAnothersAnswerTest} leaves out the class
 * that declares an answer and everything nested in it, which is right for the question it asks —
 * whether the answer left its owner — and blind to the two readers that live inside
 * {@link BehaviorInputs}. One of them wrote the defect.
 *
 * <p><b>So this counts methods and not classes.</b> The two callers were in one class file and a
 * class-level count cannot tell them apart. Read off what javac made rather than off the sources,
 * for the reason every check here is: a call is in the code however it was spelled.
