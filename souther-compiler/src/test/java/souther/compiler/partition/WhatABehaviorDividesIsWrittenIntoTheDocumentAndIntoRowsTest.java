/**
 * What a behavior divides a position into reaches the two things a division is for.
 *
 * <p>A class is a promise to two readers, and neither of them is the stage that made it. A document
 * tells a person which cases their model tells apart, and a generator writes a value into a row for
 * each of them — and a class that reaches neither is a distinction this compiler found and nobody
 * can act on.
 *
 * <p>So this is over the ends and not over any stage. Every stage between was already right about
 * its own part while a position an author had written a rule for came back undivided, which is the
 * kind of thing only the ends show.
