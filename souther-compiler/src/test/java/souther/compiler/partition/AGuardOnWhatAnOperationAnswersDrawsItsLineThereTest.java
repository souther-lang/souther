/**
 * A guard comparing what an operation answers is a line on that number, measured by what the
 * operation answers and read off the value's own order.
 *
 * <p>Only a size could be one before, and nothing said so. A term was a size or a position's own
 * content, so a guard on anything else named no term the reading had, no line was drawn, and the
 * guard went past without a word — a division the body makes that the report does not know about.
 *
 * <p>{@code Time.hour} beside {@code String.length} because the pair is what shows where each answer
 * comes from. They share nothing: different accounts of what is taken, different orders at the
 * position, and the same order for the answer. A carrier read off the account or off the kind of
 * term would have to be one answer for both, and what is actually one for both is that the operation
 * answers an {@code Int} (#1027).
 *
 * <p>And {@code Int.abs} is not among them and cannot be. It is an ordinary {@code let} over
 * {@code <} and {@code -}, so the reading takes its body and draws the line the definition draws —
 * at nought, which is where {@code n < 0} is. A term standing for the call would be a second reading
 * of the same call, and the declarations refuse to be written that way.
