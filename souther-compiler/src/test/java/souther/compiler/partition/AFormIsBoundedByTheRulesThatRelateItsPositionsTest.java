/**
 * Where a form over several positions runs is what the rules relating them leave it, and not what
 * its positions leave it one at a time.
 *
 * <p>A product of per-position ranges cannot carry a relation. Two fields each running to five come
 * to ten that way, and a record whose clause holds their sum at five has no value anywhere near it —
 * so a rule cutting the sum at eight drew a border on a quantity that never arrives there, and the
 * rows it asked for were rows nobody can write. What a report then said of each was that every value
 * tried had been refused, which is a fact about a search sent somewhere the model does not go.
 *
 * <p>Both directions, because a check that only looks for the absent lines passes on a reading that
 * draws nothing at all. A threshold inside where the form does run still draws its border and still
 * owes its rows.
