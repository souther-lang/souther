/**
 * A location measured at two numbers is two measures and one location.
 *
 * <p>Issue #1140 was the first half of that: two numbers of one location came back as neither. The
 * consumers below are the second half. Each of them held a premise that a location carries one
 * measure, and each said something different when it stopped holding — a compiler's own stop
 * reported once per number, and a row written for one class while another class of the same
 * location went unanswered.
 *
 * <p><b>The cells that steer a row are not among them, and the reason is worth writing down.</b>
 * They used to find an axis by the path a condition names, which answers a comparison about the
 * second number with the first number's axis; they ask by the number now. Neither can be told from
 * the other by anything observable, because narrowing an axis of a number taken of a location does
 * not work either way: the class of such an axis recognises what stands at the location, and what
 * it is handed there is the number — so the class holding the line is never found and the condition
 * narrows nothing. That is issue #1144 and is no part of this one.
