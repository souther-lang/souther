/**
 * A rule that names one position is measured at that position, however many times the path it names
 * goes through a declaration.
 *
 * <p><b>Two questions, and only one of them has to be bounded.</b> Enumerating what positions a type
 * can have is unbounded over a declaration that names itself, and the walk stops where a path
 * returns to one it has already opened. Resolving a path a rule wrote is not that question: the path
 * is as long as the author made it, every step of it is taken once, and it ends because the path
 * does. Answered by the same walk, a threshold an author wrote one link down a chain drew no line
 * and the report said the model states nothing there.
 *
 * <p>Which is why this is not "unfold twice". Nothing here chooses a number of unfoldings: five
 * links are measured for the same reason one is, and a model that names none is measured at none.
