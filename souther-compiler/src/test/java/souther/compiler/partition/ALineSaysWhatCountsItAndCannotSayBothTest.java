/**
 * Which of a rule's lines a line is, said by what named it, and never by both.
 *
 * <p>A declaration's clause is written in the parts its author wrote, and a line it draws is one of
 * those parts'. A part of a behavior's clause states as many things as a reading of it finds, and a
 * line it draws is one of those statements'. A comparison written in a body is a rule apiece and is
 * decomposed by nothing, so a line of it has no number under the rule at all. Three answers, and a
 * line says which of them it is.
 *
 * <p>What is held here is that no line can be built that answers two of them. Which arm a line is
 * decides what it carries, and each arm carries the identity that was issued with the line — so
 * there is no value a reader would be told belongs to a declaration and that names no part of one,
 * and none carrying a number nothing counted.
 *
 * <p>The other half of that is javac's and is not asserted here: the arm that names a part takes a
 * part of a {@code data}'s clause, the arm that names a statement takes one of a behavior's, and the
 * arm for a body takes a comparison. A test that built the wrong one to watch it be refused would be
 * a test that did not compile.
