/**
 * A position whose two coordinates are both spoken for says which rules compete for it.
 *
 * <p>A {@code String} is the one thing that can be measured two ways — its own order, and the
 * length of it — and which of them a position is measured at is settled by whichever the model
 * wrote about. Where its own type chose neither and the value it sits in states an end on each,
 * choosing either would put a line the author can read beside one they cannot see, so both rules
 * are left unread.
 *
 * <p>Both of them, and each by name. One line said the position was short of something and left the
 * author to work out which two of their clauses were in the way — and said it in the words of a
 * form this compiler cannot read, which is a cause it was never observed to have: the clauses were
 * read perfectly well.
 *
 * <p>Its own reason and not one of the three beside it. What is missing is not a reader for an
 * expression, nor a carrier, nor a class about two positions: it is a rule for which coordinate
 * wins, and an author sent after any of the other three would be looking for something that is
 * already there.
