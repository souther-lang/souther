/**
 * A number named where the reading has no position is measured on the order the declarations put
 * there.
 *
 * <p>Both cases of {@code Req} spread {@code Base}, so {@code r.deadline} is a name a value of the
 * sum is read at and is not a place a value is composed for: the reading enumerates positions under
 * each case and has none at the sum's own name, and the walk that follows a written value stops at
 * the sum because what is built there is one of the cases.
 *
 * <p>Which is the case that tells the two questions apart. What a number named there is counted on
 * follows from what the declarations put at the name, and every case spreads the same declaration —
 * so the order is there to be had whether or not anything is written at that path. Worked out from
 * the positions alone, or from the traversal that follows a written value, the answer is that
 * nothing orders it, and a rule about that number would come to no line.
