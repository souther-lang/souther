/**
 * A condition above a line over a name every case of a sum spreads is one the composer has an order
 * for.
 *
 * <p>The generator's side of what the reading answers. {@code r.deadline} is a name a value of the
 * sum is read at: the reading has no position there because it goes under each case, and the
 * traversal that follows a written value has nothing there because a row writes one of the cases. A
 * composer that took the order from the second would report a condition it was handed as one nothing
 * could put a value under — the reachability was stated, and the answer would be that there is no
 * order for it.
 *
 * <p>So what is asserted is that the way's position was placed. What becomes of the row afterwards
 * is the construction question and is answered by the traversal that owns it: no value is composed
 * at the sum's own name, and the attempt says so rather than throwing.
