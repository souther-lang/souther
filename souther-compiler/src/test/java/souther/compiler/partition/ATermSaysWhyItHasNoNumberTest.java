/**
 * A term with no number for a value says which of the two happened.
 *
 * <p>They license different sentences and are not shades of one another. An observation the run
 * could not read leaves a measure undecided: the row that was cut short may be the row at the value,
 * and calling it absent would report a gap that nothing established. A value that was read and is
 * not a number of this term is neither — it is a value this term does not hold, and calling that
 * unreadable would report a term that does not fit its position as a row nobody could read.
 *
 * <p>Fixed here rather than at each reader. A class asks this question and so does a boundary, and
 * folding the two answers into a number-or-null is how the second of them came to say "undecided"
 * to both.
