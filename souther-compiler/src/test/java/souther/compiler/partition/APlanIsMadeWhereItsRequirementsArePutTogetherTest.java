/**
 * A plan is made where the requirements of the positions it builds at are put together.
 *
 * <p>A path states what has to hold for the position it names to exist, and a caller may have
 * requirements besides — a class selects a refinement at its own position, which no path says. Both
 * go into one plan (ADR-0114: coverage and construction use one merge and neither keeps an account
 * of its own), and the defect this exists over is a caller that handed over the first and left the
 * second empty: the boundary search fixed a value at {@code query.tag@Tag} and planned against
 * {@code Requirements.NONE}, so the plan built the position as the sum and the row offered for a
 * line under {@code Tag} carried a {@code NoTag}.
 *
 * <p>What holds it is that a plan is only ever made by {@link ConstructionPlan#of}, which is where
 * the two are merged. The scan below is a tripwire under that.
