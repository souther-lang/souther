/**
 * An enumeration's count is an ordinal, and no reader outside the carrier ever sees one.
 *
 * <p>The count of the other four carriers is a number a model could plausibly have written — a day
 * count is a six-figure integer, a second count a ten-figure one, and both look wrong at a glance in
 * a report. An ordinal is 0, 1, 2. Leaked into a row it is a value the position does not hold and
 * reads like one that does; leaked into a report it names a line at a number that appears nowhere in
 * the model. It is the carrier whose leak is hardest to see, which is why it is the one held here.
 *
 * <p>What a line on an enumeration owes is asked where every other carrier's is, in
 * {@code ThresholdNormalizationTest}: an obligation is what a guard's comparison leaves, and the
 * harness that reads one is there.
