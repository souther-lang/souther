/**
 * A run holds a path and nothing else, so it is only over the walks every occurrence of that path is
 * in.
 *
 * <p>The pair of shapes is the whole of it. A walk over a sequence captured from outside the closure
 * it stands in is over every occurrence of its path, and the rule about its total is a line. A walk
 * over a sequence belonging to the closure's own parameter is over the occurrences under one element
 * of the walk outside it, and its path — inside two sequences — names every occurrence under every
 * one of them. The second is not a reading this can have until a run says which occurrences it is
 * over, and what it must not be is the first.
 *
 * <p>Held at the reading and at the representation both. The reading asks before it builds one; the
 * representation refuses one built anyway, which is what says the promise is the type's and not one
 * caller's care.
