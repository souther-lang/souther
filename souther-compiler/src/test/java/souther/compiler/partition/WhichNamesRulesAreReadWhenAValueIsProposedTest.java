/**
 * Which of the names a value wears has its rules read when a value is proposed for it.
 *
 * <p>All of them. A value written under a name is written under every name the position wears, and
 * the rules of every one of those names are rules its value is under — so each of them proposes a
 * value, and the value comes out wearing all the names whichever of them asked for it.
 *
 * <p>Held here because it is the difference between two readings of one position. The names a value
 * wears and what is left under all of them are one answer; walking to what a single name wraps is
 * another, and the two part exactly where a name wraps a name. Read the second way, a rule was
 * about whatever the walk had reached when it stopped, which was one name deep — so a name over a
 * name proposed nothing of its own, and the position was offered the value it would have had with
 * no rule written on it at all.
 *
 * <p>Innermost first, which is an order over the proposals and not over the rules. Every name's
 * rules govern the value whichever end they are read from; what the order decides is which proposal
 * a bounded search reaches before it stops.
