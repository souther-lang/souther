/**
 * How many things a combination can be asking, and what each of them says.
 *
 * <p>A combination is a class apiece at the positions it is about. Where it leaves one of them more
 * than one class it is asking more than one thing, and a search bounded at three tries should get
 * three of those.
 *
 * <p>What it used to get was three assignments. An assignment fixes every position — the ones the
 * combination is about and the ones it says nothing about alike — and the ones it says nothing about
 * are the search's own choice. Counted off together, the first three assignments of a combination
 * over one free position of four classes were one thing asked four ways, and the second thing the
 * combination could have been asking went untried however much of the bound was left.
 *
 * <p>Built here rather than read off a model. A combination that leaves two positions open beside a
 * free one is a shape a model in the corpus need not have, and a mechanism is untested for shapes
 * its data never takes.
