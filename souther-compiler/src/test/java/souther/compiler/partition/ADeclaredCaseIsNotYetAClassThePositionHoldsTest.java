/**
 * What a type declares and what a position can hold are two facts, crossed once.
 *
 * <p>{@code data StageI = Stage invariant value >= Qualified} declares three cases and holds two of
 * them: {@code StageI(Prospecting)} is refused at construction by the rule that says so. A class for
 * it would be a row nobody can write, asked for by the same report that has the rule in front of it.
 *
 * <p>Both halves are asserted because the crossing is only worth anything if the two are apart. The
 * reading of the declaration does not consult a rule, and the rule does not decide what the
 * declaration says — so neither is the other's input, and no order of working them out changes the
 * answer. Written as one reading handing its output to the other, the case comes back the day
 * somebody tidies the order.
