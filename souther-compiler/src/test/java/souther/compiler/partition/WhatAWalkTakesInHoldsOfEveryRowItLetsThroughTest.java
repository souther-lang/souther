/**
 * What a walk took in on the way to a comparison holds of every row that gets there.
 *
 * <p>The inclusion {@link souther.compiler.inputs.SearchRegion} rests on, at the place it is
 * established. A region is narrowed by exactly these cuts, so a cut that does not hold of a row
 * that arrives is a region that excludes it — and a row for a border is then looked for outside the
 * set of rows that could ever meet it, which is the one direction a coverage measure may not move
 * in.
 *
 * <p>Held against the condition itself rather than against a region. What a domain does with a cut
 * is the domain's, and two accounts of one condition can leave one region identical; an answer read
 * off the region would hold as well for a walk that took in something the condition never said.
 *
 * <p>And every shape is answered for. A condition this reading has no words for and one it read and
 * could place no constraint from are both on the list as declines, so a comparison reached under
 * nothing at all is told from one reached past something nothing could carry — which reading a
 * report gets is the whole of what an author has to go on.
