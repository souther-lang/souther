/**
 * The value a coset names for a position nothing bounds is one the rules may still refuse, and the
 * next member of it is the answer.
 *
 * <p>What the coefficients of the rest can land on says which values of a position leave them a
 * residue they reach. It says nothing about whether the rules leave the position that value: a
 * disequality takes one value out of the middle of a run without moving either end, so a position
 * carrying one looks unbounded to anything reading ranges and is refused at exactly one place.
 *
 * <p>Which is the defect a pair on a line was repaired for, and it reaches a form as readily. Here
 * the form is {@code a + b}, every whole number is on the coset, and the member the arithmetic
 * writes down is zero — the one value neither position holds. The row at the point is
 * {@code (1, -1)}, one step along.
 *
 * <p>The point is owed and this is what makes it so: with one value tried instead of several the
 * same point comes back as a search that stopped, and a point nothing is known to be writable at is
 * a point nobody is asked to write a row for.
