/**

 * positions is planned as one a whole value is chosen at — which is what a number or a record with
 * no fields is planned as, and those are the declarations saying so. Written as one word, this
 * compiler declining to look was said in the model's own words, and the composing afterwards
 * reported a value nothing was planned for as one the rules leave nothing at.
 *

 * asked for under the position, a whole value chosen there may compose a row like any other, and a
 * row is an answer. So the figure is carried and stays quiet, and the case that says so is a
 * recursive type the suite has always had — see {@code
 * ACandidateIsProposedFromTheRuleAndNotTheCarrierAloneTest}, whose tree still comes back with rows
