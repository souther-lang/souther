/**
 * A position reported as one this compiler could not read is published with what it was short of.
 *
 * <p>The end of the chain the verdict is a projection of. What leaves a position short is
 * enumerated where the verdict is made ({@code PendingPosition.complete}); the findings a document
 * is written from are made by the readers that hold those same facts. So the two agree by both
 * coming from there, and this is what says they do.
 *
 * <p><b>Not how the verdict is worked out.</b> Nothing here is an input to it, and nothing here is
 * read to produce it — a report built from a verdict, or a verdict recovered from what happened to
 * be published, is the reconstruction the accounting exists to take away. What is checked is that a
 * reader shown the first is not left with nothing to act on, and that a reader shown a position the
 * model states something about is not sent after a limit that is not there.
