/**
 * Which reading stopped at a position decides what the position is short of, and a stop of one is
 * not an answer about the other.
 *
 * <p>Two readings answer about one position and they are asked different things. What the classes
 * are made of is which values may stand there; where the border falls is where they stop. So a rule
 * the first read from end to end and the second could not follow leaves the classes exactly as the
 * rules leave them — and a verdict that read "a reading stopped here" off a list holding both said
 * this compiler could not work out how the position divides, about a position every rule of which
 * it had divided.
 *
 * <p><b>And the border is not short of it either, which is a third answer and not the first.</b>
 * Whether the rule states a line at all is settled by the reading that has the arithmetic of a
 * comparison ({@code check.StatedLines}): a call restricting which strings may stand somewhere
 * orders none of them, so there is no end here for anything to be waiting on. That the reading of
 * ends has no word for the rule is a fact about that reading and is not promoted to an end nobody
 * worked out.
 *
 * <p>Which is not "the values read it, so the ends are answered". The two vocabularies stay apart:
 * what closes this is that the line's existence was decided, not that another reader managed the
 * clause. The control below is a rule that does state a line, on a number this compiler cannot
 * name, and it is short of it still.
 *
 * <p><b>The pair, and not either half.</b> A test that only asked for the border would pass over a
 * partition quietly widened; one that only asked for the partition would pass over a border quietly
 * closed. What is held here is that one model moves one of them and not the other.
 *
 * <p>The model is a choice whose alternatives the reading of values takes in whole — a value
 * written out, and a pattern — where one of them says nothing about where the strings stop.
