/**
 * An axis is a run of classes over one number, and the classes it holds are classes of that number.
 *
 * <p>Two things a class can be of, and only one of them can be asked with a place on the number's
 * order: a class about a count says which number it counts, and every other class is about the value
 * standing at the position. A class of the second kind on an axis measuring something taken of the
 * position leaves the two with nothing to compare — a class of times has no answer about which run a
 * minute falls in — and asking anyway comes back as the class not being found, which reads as the
 * rules dividing the position nowhere.
 *
 * <p>Built by hand here rather than searched for in a model. No model this compiler reads today
 * produces such an axis, which is the reason to hold the rule at the way in rather than to rely on
 * the corpus: what is being fixed is that the axis cannot be built, and a fixture that has to be
 * found first would be a test of which models exist.
