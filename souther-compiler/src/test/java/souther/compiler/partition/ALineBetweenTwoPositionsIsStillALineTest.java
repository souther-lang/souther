/**
 * A {@code guard} comparing one position against another draws a line, and the rows are owed it.
 *
 * <p>The line is where the two are equal. A guard's arms are above the line and below-or-on it, so a
 * row on the line takes the same arm as one well below it, and the arms cannot stand in for it — a
 * row on the line is the one thing that tells a rule written {@code >} from one written {@code >=}
 * (spec §every-border-has-a-row-against-its-line).
 *
 * <p>Nothing asked for it. The reader that turns a comparison into a line wants a constant on one
 * side, and where there is none it produced nothing at all: no line, no obligation, and a note saying
 * the partition could not read the comparison — which is not a demand and is counted nowhere. So a
 * model whose every rule is of this shape reported every measure full and {@code --strict} exited
 * {@code 0} while nothing had ever been evaluated at the line each rule turns on.
 *
 * <p>Which positions those are is asked of the carrier and not of the type. Two operands compare only
 * when they are of one type, and a type is not what makes a line measurable: two newtypes of one base
 * are two types ordered alike and have a line, while two positions each declared as one case of an
 * enumeration are comparable on their sum's order, range over less than it, and have none.
