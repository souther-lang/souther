/**
 * A position the body named and the enumeration did not is measured by everything that measures a
 * position, and not by a line drawn on it and nothing else.
 *
 * <p><b>What a position carries and what an axis carries are not the same list.</b> An axis is a
 * number and the classes drawn on it; a position is that and the ends its declarations put on it,
 * the rules that reached it and came to no line, what its reading was left with. Assembled at the
 * axis, a position arrived at by being named carried the type it stands at and none of the rest —
 * so a line an author drew outside what the position's own invariant admits was kept rather than
 * dropped, and a position with no account of its reading had nothing to answer when asked for one.
 *
 * <p>So this holds the two answers against each other: the same rule, at a position the enumeration
 * reaches and at one only the body names, comes to the same verdict.
