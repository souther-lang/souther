 * value above it. The second is answered by asking for the first today, and the point of writing them
 * as two is that it need not stay that way. Held here rather than through the report, because a size
 * larger than a row is worth carrying is one the measure calls undecided before the generator is
 * asked, so the report has no way to show which half of the answer was given.
