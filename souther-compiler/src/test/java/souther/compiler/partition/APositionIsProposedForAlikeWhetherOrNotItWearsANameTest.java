/**
 * A position and the same position under a name are proposed for alike.
 *
 * <p>One route. The position is read, and the value is chosen from the shape that reading came to —
 * so what a name does is decide how the value is spelled and nothing else. A {@code Bool} divides
 * into two and an {@code Option} into present and absent whether or not a name is worn over it, and
 * which of those the position stands for is settled before any name goes back on.
 *
 * <p>Written down before the routes were joined, when there were two. A position whose type was
 * written as a primitive was answered from what the primitive is, and one wearing a name was asked
 * what it divides into first — so the two chose the value by different readings and nothing said
 * they agreed. They did, and pinning that is what made joining them a change that keeps the answers
 * rather than one that quietly picks a different row.
