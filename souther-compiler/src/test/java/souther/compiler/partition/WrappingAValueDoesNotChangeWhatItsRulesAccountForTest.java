/**
 * Wrapping a value in a name does not change what its rules leave or who accounts for it.
 *
 * <p>The rules are the same rules and the value is the same value: a newtype over a type states
 * what that type states, and a clause written on either reaches the value it is about. So the two
 * models leave the position the same values, and the same authored lines are owed a row at the same
 * places.
 *
 * <p>Which the counterfactual has to be asked on both roads for. A clause reaches a value either as
 * its own declaration's, which the gathering takes in, or as the declaration it wraps, which the
 * guarantee walk does — and a reading asked to leave a conjunct out on one road only leaves it in
 * on the other. What comes back then is a reading identical to the whole one, which is the answer a
 * set of rules that accounts for nothing gets.
