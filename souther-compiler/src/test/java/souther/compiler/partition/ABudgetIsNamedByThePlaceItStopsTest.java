/**
 * A composer that stops at a figure of this compiler's says which figure, at the figure and not one
 * short of it.
 *
 * <p>Put to the producer directly and one either side of the line. What a search comes back with is
 * the same word whether it walked everything it had or stopped at a number — so a test that only
 * asked what it came back with would pass while the number and the name had come apart, which is
 * the whole of what a budget travelling as itself is for.
 *
 * <p>The figures are read from {@link CompositionBudget} rather than written here. A budget raised
 * moves this test with it, and a test holding its own copy of the number would go on asking about a
 * line the compiler no longer has.
 *
 * <p><b>Only the figures a producer can be put either side of on its own.</b> How many elements a
 * total is spread over is reached by what the elements may hold rather than by the total, so one
 * side of it takes a model whose elements are bounded — that one is held against a model, and what
 * is here is the half that a call can ask for.
