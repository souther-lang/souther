 * <p>The second of a clause's two decompositions. Which part of a clause a conjunct is was written
 * by its author and is named where the clause is split ({@link PartId}); what one of those parts
 * states is read off the tree the part expanded into, where a helper's body brings connectives
 * nobody wrote — so a part states as many things as the reading finds, and which of them a line came
 * out of is the number this is about.
 *
 * <p>Two things are held, and they are the two that went wrong when this number had no name. It is
 * counted in one place, so that a reader cannot arrive at a statement's number by walking the part
 * again; and it is held in one place, so that a reader cannot put a number it has beside a part it
 * is holding. Counted where the lines were drawn, the number ran on across the parts of the clause —
 * one running count answering both which part the author wrote and which thing that part states, and
 * neither recoverable from it.
 *
 * <p>Read off the compiled classes, because what a type carries and what a method calls are what the
 * class file says.
