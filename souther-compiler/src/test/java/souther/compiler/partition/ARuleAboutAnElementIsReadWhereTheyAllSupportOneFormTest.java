/**

 * container written with one number under the field a rule compares against states that number, and
 * one written with two states neither — and which of those it is turns on the numbers rather than on
 * how many elements were written or which cases they are.
 *
 * <p>Read at the arithmetic and not at the report. What a comparison inside a repeated closure is
 * then worth to a measure is a second question with an owner of its own; this one is about the
 * number a rule cuts, which is what a reader of the model would have to be able to state before any
