/**
 * A line is a place on the order of the number the rules cut, and the class it falls in is asked
 * with that place.
 *
 * <p>The two orders a measure has are not the same one. What stands at {@code slot.at} is a time,
 * written on the order a time is written on; what {@code Time.minute} answers is a whole number, and
 * a line drawn by {@code >= 30} is at thirty on that second order. Asked with a value of the first —
 * the place turned back into something a row could hold — a class about the minute is handed a whole
 * number where it expects a time, reads no minute out of it, and says it holds nothing. Every class
 * says that, so the line falls in none of them and the condition narrows nothing.
 *
 * <p>Which is why the case below is a time and not an {@code Int}. Where the number is what stands at
 * the position the two orders coincide, the round trip through a value comes back to the same place,
 * and nothing about a lookup written either way can be told apart.
