 * A region is narrowed by exactly the conditions the account it is built from says were taken in.
 *
 * <p>The other half of what {@link WayToTheBorder} promises. That the cuts a walk took in hold of
 * every row that arrives is about the walk and is held elsewhere; this is about what the account
 * means — that the region it makes is the one it describes, in the order it describes, and that a
 * condition written down as declined reaches the domains not at all.
 *
 * <p>Measured against a region that records what it is told rather than against what the numbers
 * come to. What a domain does with a cut is the domain's business and two different cuts can leave
 * one region unchanged, so an answer read off the values would hold just as well if half the
 * account were fiction.
