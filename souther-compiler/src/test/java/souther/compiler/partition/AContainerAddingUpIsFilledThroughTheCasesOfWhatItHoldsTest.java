/**
 * A container is filled to a total through the cases of what it holds.

 * <p>Where every case of a sum spreads the same declaration, a field of it is read through the sum:
 * the total {@code List.sum(ns[*].method.amount)} names a position of the sum and no case of it,
 * which is what makes the rule readable and is not enough to write a value with. A value of that
 * position is a value of one of the cases, and which one is a fact about the value — so the walk
 * offers one shape per case rather than choosing.
 *
 * <p>The way down is the plan's. Walked from the declarations instead, a field of a plain record at
 * a time, the sum was a shape it had no answer for: every count and every spread came back with
 * nothing built, and the point the total was about was reported in the words of a figure this
 * compiler had stopped at.
