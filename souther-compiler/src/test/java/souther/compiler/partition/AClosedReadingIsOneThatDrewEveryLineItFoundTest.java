/**

 * <p>{@code Closed} is what takes a behavior out of the verdict, and it used to follow from three
 * absences: nothing was set aside, nothing went unanswered, no position went unreached. A line
 * dropped before it could be set aside leaves all three of those exactly as they were, so a measure
 * built from them reported a model read in full on the strength of a reading that had lost part of
 * it — a {@code Decimal} bounded by two clauses came back as a behavior whose rules draw no line
 * anywhere, and the module was called adequate (issue #1079).
 *
 * <p>So what the reading produced is held against what it found, by identity. Counted instead, a
 * reading that lost one line and made another twice comes back whole; asked of the lines themselves,
 * neither is possible.
