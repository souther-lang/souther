/**
 * A rule whose strings are one stretch of the order they are measured on bounds the position, and
 * is owed the row at the place they begin.
 *
 * <p>{@code String.startsWith("JP", value)} admits exactly the strings from {@code "JP"} up to but
 * not including {@code "JQ"}, and a string is measured on the order the runtime compares them on. So
 * the position stops in two places, and a rule stating that in a comparison and one stating it as a
 * predicate leave it in the same two — the second was read as a rule holding the position to what it
 * admits and drawing no line, which is true of the format beside it and not of this.
 *
 * <p>What a rule states about the strings and where the strings stop are two questions here. The
 * first is settled by the reading that turns clauses into sets and is settled whether or not this
 * compiler could work out the text written in the rule; the second is asked only of a language it
 * has. So a format whose strings are not one stretch, and a rule this could read no language out of,
 * come back with no edge for reasons that are not the same reason.
