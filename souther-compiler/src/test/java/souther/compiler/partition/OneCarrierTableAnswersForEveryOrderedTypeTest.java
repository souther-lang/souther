/**
 * What each ordered type is measured at, written out rather than left to be inferred.
 *
 * <p>Which values a line can be drawn on used to be decided in several places, and they disagreed:
 * a {@code Date} was a carrier to the reader that drew a {@code guard}'s line and not to the one
 * that read an invariant's bound, so the same rule about the same position answered two ways
 * depending on where it was written. A table of the answers is what makes that visible — a
 * disagreement is two cells of one row differing, which nothing shorter than this shows.
 *
 * <p>Three numbers per cell and not one. How many positions the model divides, how many lines the
 * rules drew, and what the reading could not read are three separate answers, and a cell that got
 * the first right and the third wrong is what {@code not derivable} on a bounded position was.
 *
 * <p><b>Every carrier appears in both rows.</b> A rule written as an invariant and the same rule
 * written as a {@code guard} reach the measure through different readers, so a row missing from one
 * of them is a reader nothing holds to the other. The bare and the wrapped forms are both here for
 * the same reason: a newtype is the value it carries (spec §primitives), and a cell where the two
 * differ is a name changing what a rule means.
