/**

 *
 * <p>Every one of these used to be a coverage item that was never built. The obligation was left out
 * of a list, and all of them reached a reader as the same thing — one fewer entry — so a reader
 * counting the four items the technique asks for found this compiler short and was never told which
 * of them had happened. Two of the three are not shortfalls at all: the rules refusing the point is
 * the model having discharged it, and a carrier naming no value one step over is an item that cannot
 * exist.
 *
 * <p>Each reason is measured against a model that differs from it in one thing and owes the row. An
 * expectation on one model alone holds against a reader that answers "not owed" everywhere, which is
 * exactly what leaving the entry out amounted to.
