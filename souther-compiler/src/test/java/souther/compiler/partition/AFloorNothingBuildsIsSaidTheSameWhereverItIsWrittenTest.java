 * a reader looking for the rule that refuses them; "nothing here composes one" is about this compiler,
 * and a list of a hundred thousand is a value somebody could write and this will not. Which of the two
 * a position gets was read off its type alone, so a floor written on the record that has the position
 * got the wrong one — the same asymmetry as #650, in the half that explains rather than builds.
