/**
 * A position the model states the values of is measured, whichever way the model states them.
 *
 * <p>Two spellings of one distinction. A sum with two cases and a newtype whose invariant admits two
 * values divide their position exactly alike — every value of it is one or the other, and a row sits
 * in one of them — and one of them was owed a row for the second class while the other was owed
 * nothing.
 *
 * <p>The one that was owed nothing was not merely unmeasured. Its report said the model draws no
 * distinction at that position, which is a sentence about the model, and the model says otherwise in
 * its own declaration. That is what a derivation reading two producers and calling their silence an
 * absence comes to: the third producer had the answer and was not part of what "everything was
 * asked" meant.
 *
 * <p>So what is fixed here is the shape of the two answers, not their spellings. A class off a sum
 * is named by the case and a class off an equality is named by the value, and no reading is asked to
 * make those one word.
