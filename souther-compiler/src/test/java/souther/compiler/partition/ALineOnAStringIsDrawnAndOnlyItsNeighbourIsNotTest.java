/**
 * A rule written over a string is measured as far as the values go, which is all of it but one row.
 *
 * <p>Four things a measure produces at a line, and only the last needs something a string has not:
 * the line itself, the classes either side of it, a row at the line, and a row just below it. The
 * first three need the order, which the language defines on a string; the fourth needs the value
 * before another one, which it does not name.
 *
 * <p>It produced none of the four. The algebra held every ordered value as one number and a string
 * has none to count to, so a position holding one was closed at the entrance and the report said the
 * comparison was against values no line could be drawn on — of values the language orders, two lines
 * below a body that compares them.
 *
 * <p>What that cost is the whole of this: a build could not refuse over it. The same rule written
 * over an {@code Int} is a gap the rows must fill, and written over a {@code String} it was a
 * position nothing was known about — so the type an author reached for decided whether the boundary
 * rule applied to them at all.
