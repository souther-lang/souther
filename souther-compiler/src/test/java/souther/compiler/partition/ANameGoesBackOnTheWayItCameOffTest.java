/**
 * A name comes off to say what a position is and goes back on to say what stands at it.
 *
 * <p>The two directions are one fact and have to be read as one. A {@code data DecisionN = Decision}
 * divides into {@code Decision}'s cases — which is the reading that stopped at the name before
 * (issue #631) — and a row at that position writes {@code DecisionN(Approved { id = 1 })}, which is
 * that reading run backwards. Three things have to hold together for an axis to be worth anything:
 * the classes are derived, a value for one is written under the names, and a value somebody already
 * wrote is read back into its class. Any one of them alone is an axis nothing can be measured at.
 *
 * <p>Which is why the wrapper order is pinned against written-out values in both directions rather
 * than against each other. Put on and taken off by the same wrong order, a round trip through the
 * two would agree with itself and every row would carry {@code DecisionN(DecisionNN(...))}.
