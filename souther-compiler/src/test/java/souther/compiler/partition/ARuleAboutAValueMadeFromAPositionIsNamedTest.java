/**
 * A rule an author wrote about a value an operation made from a position is named at that position.
 *
 * <p>Not measured there. What a {@code map} answers is made from what stands at a position and is
 * not those values, so a line drawn there would be at values the rule is not about — and an author
 * cannot tell such a line from one their model states. Reading the rule back through the closure is
 * a different capability and not one this has.
 *
 * <p>What it must not be is silent. The author wrote a comparison; a reading that placed it nowhere
 * reported a model that states no rule there, which is the answer a body with no rule in it gives.
 * So where the values came from is said, and that what the rule says about them here is not worked
 * out.
 *
 * <p>Both ends of that relation are bindings an expansion wrote. The operation is gone by the time
 * anything reads the tree — a walk that only grows a collection is rewritten, and two such walks in
 * a row are joined into one — so what says the values came from there was written where the
 * operation still stood.
