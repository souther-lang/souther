/**
 * A value asked for under a sum is a value asked for under one of its cases, and the plan says
 * which cases there are rather than choosing one.
 *
 * <p>Where every case spreads the same declaration, a field of it is read through the sum: the path
 * names a position of the sum and no case of it (spec §sum-data), which is enough to read a rule at
 * and not enough to write a value with. So the reading and the writing part here, and what the
 * writing needs is the one thing the reading did not have to say.
 *
 * <p><b>What a plan must not do with such a demand is drop it.</b> A sum composes nothing out of
 * anything, so a whole value is chosen there and a path fixed below it has nowhere to be written —
 * the arrangement {@code ConstructionPlan.Result.Beyond} refuses at the depth figure, met at a
 * position instead of at a depth. Handed back as an ordinary plan, the composing satisfies it and
 * the caller's value is quietly missing from what was built.
