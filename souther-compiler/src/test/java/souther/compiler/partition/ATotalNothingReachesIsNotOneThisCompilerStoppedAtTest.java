 * A total the rules leave no container for comes back as one nothing here writes a container for.
 *
 * <p>Every count the rules admit is tried and every shape of each of them, and the figures are
 * nowhere near: the rules hold the container to fewer elements than one is worth carrying, and the
 * shapes a decomposition takes are all offered at each count. So what is left when nothing is
 * composed is the model, and a walk that came back naming a figure would be sending a reader to
 * raise a number that took nothing away from them.
 *
 * <p><b>Held to a container the counts run out inside.</b> A list nothing bounds has counts above
 * the figure that were never tried, and a figure reached there is a figure that really did decline
 * to go on — which is a different answer and not this one. What this pins is the case where the
 * counts are exhausted before any figure is met.
