/**
 * Two spellings of one number are one level, so they are one demand and one debt.
 *
 * <p>A level keeps the spelling the rule was written in, because that is what a report writes back:
 * {@code 0} and {@code 0.00} are two values and one place on the order. Everything that compares
 * levels goes through the order, and a value that <em>holds</em> a level and is compared as a value
 * cannot — a map keyed on a debt asks {@link Object#equals}, and a check that two readings ask the
 * same thing asks it of two criteria. Those readers hold the level written the one way.
 *
 * <p>What this is for is the check itself. Two readings of one line that disagree about what a point
 * asks for say the identity that put them together is wrong, and that is only worth acting on where
 * a disagreement is one: over a spelling it names a defect that is not there.
