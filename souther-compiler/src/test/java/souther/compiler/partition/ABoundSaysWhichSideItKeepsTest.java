 * so a minimum is known to be a minimum there and nowhere else. What is left to recover it from
 * further down is the range the rules leave the position — and that is every rule's answer and not
 * this one's, so a bound at a value both ends stand at comes back the same for both of them, and a
 * bound at a value neither end stands at comes back as nothing at all.
 *
 * <p>What the range is still worth is a check. Which way the bound runs and where the position stops
 * are two readings of the same rules, and a bound's line is the end of what it leaves on the side it
 * keeps — so the two are held against each other and a model that puts them at odds stops the build.
