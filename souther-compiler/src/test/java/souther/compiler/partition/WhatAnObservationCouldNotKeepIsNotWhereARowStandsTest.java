/**
 * A value an observation could not keep is not a value standing somewhere else.
 *
 * <p>Every limit an observation is walked under produces one word — the value is not there and the
 * walk stopped — and what the word is <em>of</em> travels with it. From there the reading has one
 * job: to arrive at the border still saying that nothing could be read, rather than that the row
 * does not stand at the point. The two are a number that did not come back and a number that came
 * back wrong, and only the second is about what somebody wrote.
 *
 * <p>Written by hand, so what is held is the reading and not a model's answer. Which budget stopped
 * the walk is the observation's own question and is settled where the limits are; every one of them
 * hands over the same {@link ObservedValue.Truncated}, so a reading that keeps the word for one
 * keeps it for all four, and holding this against four models would be holding the same law four
 * times.
