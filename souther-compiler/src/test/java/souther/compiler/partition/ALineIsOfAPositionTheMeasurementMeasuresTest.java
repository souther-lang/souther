/**
 * A line a measurement reads is a line that measurement drew.
 *
 * <p>Which lines there are was settled when the input was measured. So what makes a border one of
 * this measurement's is not that its behavior, its numbers, the position it is on and the orders it
 * is measured on each agree with this one — those are the attributes of a value that already has an
 * identity, and comparing them one at a time is a derivation that is never finished. It is that
 * this measurement drew it.
 *
 * <p>And what comes back is the line the measurement holds rather than the one handed in. A reader
 * of a line asks it what it demands of a row and where the run below it stops, and answers off the
 * value it was given — so a caller's copy would be read in place of the reading's own, whatever it
 * carried where the caller got it.
