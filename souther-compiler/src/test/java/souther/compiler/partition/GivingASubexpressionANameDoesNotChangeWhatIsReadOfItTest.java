/**
 * A name given a subexpression is that subexpression, so binding one changes nothing about what the
 * model is read to say.
 *
 * <p>What a {@code let} binds is evaluated on the way to the answer, so a body that names an
 * expression and then compares the name is comparing the expression. A reading that stopped at the
 * name answered a position or nothing, and a name given arithmetic over positions is neither — so
 * one such name took the whole rule away: the line the model draws was not drawn, the positions the
 * rule is about were not named, and the reason a rule went unread was not given either, because no
 * reader got as far as having a rule to report.
 *
 * <p>Measured against the spelling that writes the expression where it is compared, rather than
 * against numbers written down here. What the two have to agree on is the positions, the lines and
 * the reasons, and an expectation repeated twice would go on holding if both fell silent together.
 *
 * <p>The last pair is the one that must not agree by reading through. An operation's answer holding
 * what a closure made of an element is not the element's position, so a name standing for one of
 * those values is not the expression the closure wrote — put where the name stands, it would draw a
 * line at a position whose values are not the ones the rule is about, which an author cannot tell
 * from a line their model states.
