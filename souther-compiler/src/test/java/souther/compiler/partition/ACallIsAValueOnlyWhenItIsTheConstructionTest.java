/**
 * A value written down is told from a call that answers with one, and the type does not tell them
 * apart.
 *
 * <p>Which line a comparison draws is read off the value on the other side, and the only expressions
 * that carry one are the ones a model writes the value with. A call to something else answers a
 * value nobody here knows: the text inside {@code openingAt("16:00:00")} is an argument, and what
 * comes back is whatever the implementation makes of it.
 *
 * <p>Read off the answer's type instead, the argument became the line. That is a boundary this
 * compiler made up — the position was reported divided at a value no rule in the model states, and
 * the rows generated for it name a class nothing said exists. Which is worse than the position
 * coming back unread, because a reader has no way to tell it from a line the model drew.
 *
 * <p>Both readers are here. A {@code guard} reaches the comparison as {@code Core} and an invariant
 * as {@code Hir}, so a rule read at one and not the other is a rule about the representation.
