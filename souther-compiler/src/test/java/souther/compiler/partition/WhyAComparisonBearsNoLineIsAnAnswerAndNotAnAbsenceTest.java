/**
 * A comparison that bears no line says which of the reasons it is.
 *
 * <p>They are not one answer. A truth nothing reads is one the behavior draws no boundary on at all;
 * a comparison no run answers through is one whose outcome is about no row, arrived at from where
 * it stands rather than from what reads it. Neither is reported, and which of the two refused a
 * comparison is a fact the policy has when it refuses — folded into one {@code false}, whoever
 * needs it next works it out again.
 *
 * <p>What a comparison is written inside is no part of this. A step a combinator applies once per
 * element is passed as many times as there are elements, and the two written here stand together to
 * say that the policy admits both: what each of them comes to is settled by the arithmetic, over
 * the container the input walk names and over the one written in the body alike.
