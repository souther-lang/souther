/**
 * A name written over a record takes its fields from the record and its rules from both.
 *
 * <p>Two declarations meet at such a position and they answer different questions. What the value
 * is made of is the record's answer, and the reading names that record — a walk stopping at the
 * outer name would find a position with no fields at all. What the value must satisfy is written on
 * either declaration and both reach it, so a reader taking only one of them offers a value the
 * other refuses.
 *
 * <p>Which is why the two are pinned against written-out rows rather than against each other. The
 * field structure and the rules are read by different parts of this compiler, and they agree here
 * only because each asks the declaration its own question is about. A reader that took the fields
 * from one declaration and the rules from the other would pass every test that compared the two
 * readings with one another.
