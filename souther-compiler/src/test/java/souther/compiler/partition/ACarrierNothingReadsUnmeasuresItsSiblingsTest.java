/**
 * A position whose rules one reader cannot read does not take its siblings' measurements with it.
 *
 * <p>Whether a row can be written at an edge is asked of the whole value a position sits in — a rule
 * about some other field can refuse to be part of any value with this edge in it — so one unreadable
 * rule anywhere under a parameter puts every boundary under it beyond what anything promises. That is
 * the right shape, and it is why the reading has to be complete for the rules it can actually read.
 *
 * <p>It was not. Whether an ordered rule became a bound was answered by the reader that maps rules to
 * the checks a decoder emits, which knows about patterns and sizes and has no word for a comparison
 * of dates — while the interval algebra read the same clause as a bound without difficulty. So a
 * {@code Date} field with an invariant made its record's reading incomplete, and the {@code Int}
 * beside it lost its two boundaries from the denominator: an axis nobody had touched stopped being
 * measured because of what its neighbour was declared as.
 *
 * <p>What fixes it is one interpreter for ordered rules, taking the carrier from the ordered type.
 * What this holds is the consequence: adding a bounded {@code Date} field to a record leaves every
 * other position's obligations exactly as they were.
