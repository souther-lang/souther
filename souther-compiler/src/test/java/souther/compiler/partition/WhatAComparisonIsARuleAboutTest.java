/**
 * What a comparison is a rule about, which decides what it raises.
 *
 * <p><b>Read off the canonical form, and off nothing else.</b> Which quantity a comparison cuts is
 * the arithmetic's answer, and what the comparison is a rule about follows from that same answer —
 * {@code a + 1 <= 10} and {@code a <= b - b + 9} are both {@code a <= 9}, so both are rules about
 * {@code a}. Worked out beside the line instead, from the operands as they were written, the first
 * came back naming no position and the second came back a rule about a pair: a border was drawn at
 * a position nothing was owed about, and a question was raised about a place the rule never
 * stopped.
 *
 * <p>So the rows vary two things and no third. What the sides read — a constant, an input the row
 * chooses, the answer the behavior gives — and how the arithmetic reads them. A row that varies
 * only the spelling is here to fix that the spelling does not matter.
