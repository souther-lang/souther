/**
 * A collection the rules leave no room in is answered as that, and not as a figure this compiler
 * reached while finding out.
 *
 * <p>The two can be true of one point at once, and it is the ordinary case rather than a contrived
 * one: where the model has no row, the search refuses everything it composes and goes on composing
 * until it meets a bound. So which of the two a reader is told turns on nothing about the model,
 * and everything about which was asked first.
 *
 * <p><b>What settles it is that only one of them is actionable.</b> A proof that no collection
 * holds what is being placed in it stands however far this compiler read; an author sent to raise
 * the figure beside it would raise it and be told the same thing. So the proof is made where the
 * plan is, before any search runs, and the search that would have named a figure never happens.
 *
 * <p>The pair below is the same rule read against two states of the row. Where the cap's own field
 * is settled at nought, the rules leave no room and the plan refuses; where it is settled at one,
 * they leave room for exactly what is placed, and a row is written. The proof is not a property of
 * the rule but of the rule and what the row has fixed.
