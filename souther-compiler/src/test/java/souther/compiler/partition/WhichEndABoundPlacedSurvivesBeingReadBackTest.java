 * is derived, from that end together with whether the bound admits the threshold. So a reader
 * holding the derived pair and wanting the end back has to run that derivation backwards, and the
 * two are one law read in two directions.
 *
 * <p><b>Read off the side alone, half the rules a model can write come back inverted.</b> The two
 * agree wherever a bound admits its own threshold and disagree wherever it does not — so
 * {@code a <= b} lands on the end it was written with and {@code a < b} lands on the other one, and
 * a line whose sides are the wrong way round asks for two rows that prove nothing.
 *
 * <p>Held as the table rather than as one example. Which of the four a fixture happens to exercise
 * is not a property of the law, and the two that agree pass under either reading.
