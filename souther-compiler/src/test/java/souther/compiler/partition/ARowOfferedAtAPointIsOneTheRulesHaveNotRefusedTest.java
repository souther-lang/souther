/**
 * A row offered at a point of a form is one the rules have not been shown to refuse.
 *
 * <p>The search narrows what it walks by reading the rules again as it fixes positions, and how much
 * of that it is willing to pay for is its own affair — past a budget it walks the wider box the
 * ranges alone describe, which holds every assignment the rules leave and some they do not. Giving
 * that up is giving up precision.
 *
 * <p>What it may not give up is the answer it hands back. An assignment picked out of the wider box
 * and never held against the rules is one the record can refuse, and a row offered there is refused
 * where it is built — which a report says as every value having been tried, of a point some other
 * pair stands at perfectly well. That is the defect this whole reading exists to remove, arriving by
 * way of a budget rather than by way of a missing question.
 *
 * <p>So the narrowing is budgeted and the last step is not: an assignment is handed back only where
 * the rules, with every position of it fixed, were not shown to leave nothing. Where that cannot be
 * said the search has not settled the point, which is a different sentence from having tried.
 *
 * <p>The box here is wide enough that the narrowing runs out well before the walk does, which is
 * what the smaller models in this package do not reach.
