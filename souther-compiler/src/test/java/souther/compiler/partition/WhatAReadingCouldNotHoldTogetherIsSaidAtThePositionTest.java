/**
 * A reading that ran to the end of the rules and could not hold what they say together says so at
 * the positions it read.
 *
 * <p>Not among what went unread. Every rule arrived and every rule was taken in, and what is left is
 * a product standing for a relation it is wider than — so an author sent to look for a clause this
 * compiler could not read would be looking for one that does not exist. Issue #877, at the surface
 * a report is written from.
 *
 * <p>Said whether or not the position came back divided, which is what tells it from a stop. A stop
 * is what a position is left with when nothing answered for it; this is a qualification of the
 * classes themselves, and a position with classes is exactly where it matters — a class made out of
 * a set wider than the rules leave is a class no value can be in.
