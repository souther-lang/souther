/**
 * A row is read at a position by what the reading exposes there, and never by what its value
 * happens to carry.
 *
 * <p>Two ways of getting this wrong and they are opposite. A walk that asks where a value is
 * <em>written</em> reaches nothing at a name every case of a sum spreads — the name is readable at
 * the sum and a row writes one of the cases — so every point on a line over such a total came back
 * undecided while the row standing on it was in the file. A walk that took the name off whatever
 * value it held instead would read a case's own field on the rows that are that case and refuse it
 * on the rest, which is a readability decided per row and is not something the model states.
 *
 * <p>So a field is admitted by {@code check.ReadableFields} and then taken from the value in hand.
 * The rows here carry the second half of that: a {@code Card} holds its own {@code cardNumber} as
 * well as the {@code amount} it spreads, so the case that must not be readable is one every row of
 * it does carry.
 *
 * <p><b>And a narrowing is how a case's own field is reached.</b> A path that names the case reads
 * what only that case declares, which the model says by spelling the case; a row at another case
 * takes that step and stands nowhere below it, which is a row that is somewhere else and not a walk
 * that could not be made. Those two answers are what tells a point nothing covers from a point
 * nothing could be told about.
