/**
 * A form reads each of its positions on the order that position is written on, and is over
 * positions written back differently where the arithmetic puts them together.
 *
 * <p>A quantity used to answer with the one order every position under it was on. A coordinate has
 * one and a line between two positions has one, so nothing forced the two questions apart — which
 * order a position is read and written on, and which orders a form may be over. A form was held to
 * the same answer, and one over a {@code Decimal} position and an {@code Int} one was refused
 * without a word: the reading returned no quantity, and a rule the model states drew no border.
 *
 * <p><b>And no rule here about which orders may be added.</b> Which positions a form weighs, and
 * with what, is settled before a quantity is built. A refusal written here would be written without
 * the coefficients, and the coefficients are what decides: {@code b + a} over two dates leaves an
 * origin in, {@code b - a - n} cancels it and is a count of days against a number, and the two are
 * the same orders in the same numbers. That second form is what issue #949 asks for, so a rule
 * refusing it is the thing being repaired rather than a guard on the repair.
