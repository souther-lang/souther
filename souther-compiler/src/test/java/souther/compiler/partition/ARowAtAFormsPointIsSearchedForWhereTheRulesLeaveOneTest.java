/**
 * A row at a point of a form is looked for where the rules leave one, not in the box around them.
 *
 * <p>Where a border is drawn and where a row for it can be written are two questions, and the second
 * is the one a search answers. Handed the ends of each position and nothing else, a search walks a
 * box that the rule relating those positions has cut a corner off: it offers an assignment inside
 * the box, the value it was for is refused at construction, and a report says that every value tried
 * was refused — of a point some other assignment sits at perfectly well.
 *
 * <p>The reach is right here and the search is not, which is what tells the two apart. Each position
 * already runs between ends the relation narrowed, and their sum already runs exactly as far as the
 * form does; the pair {@code (4, 0)} satisfies every rule and stands at the point the report says
 * nothing could be composed for.
 *
 * <p>Both directions. A reading that composed nothing anywhere would pass a check that only looks
 * for the absent sentence, so what a row does reach is asserted beside it.
