/**
 * A declaration is named as taking a run's end in only where that is the end it was read at.
 *
 * <p>Two readings reach a border and they are readings of different rules. Which declarations hold
 * an end comes from the value the position sits in, and is worked out against the number that
 * reading arrived at; where the run actually stops is what every rule reaching the behavior leaves
 * the term, which that reading knew nothing of. So the two can leave the position in different
 * places, and a name carried across without asking is a name written against a number no clause of
 * that declaration moved — an author sent to a line that admits every value the run stops short of.
 *
 * <p>Assembled here rather than read from a model. What decides this is which end the reading was
 * asked about, and a model reaching the case where the two ends differ is a separate question about
 * what the declarations can be made to say — one this does not answer and does not need to.
