 * Every row the reading was given is in one of its counts.

 * watched it and no rule could be told, or nothing watched it at all. A run with no account did not
 * go nowhere — it went somewhere nothing recorded, which is this compiler's shortfall and says
 * nothing about the model.
 *
 * <p>So the reading is held to accounting for what it was given. Written as the accounts that came
 * back, a row that left none is in no number at all, and a reading short of a row reads exactly
 * like one that read every one of them.
