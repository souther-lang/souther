/**
 * What a measurement went without is a set of facts, and what tells two facts apart is what the
 * fact says it is.
 *
 * <p>Three of the arms hold more than the fact. An observation carries where it was said, a rule
 * with no line carries the handle an author is sent to, and a question that stands carries both
 * that handle and what each part of it was short of — and every one of those is declared, at the
 * type that holds it, to be no part of what tells one from another. A rule this compiler could not
 * read, met from two behaviors and cited at whichever place each of them was reading, is one thing
 * to tell a person.
 *
 * <p>So the union folds on the fact and never on the value. Folded on the value, a set that says
 * it holds each fact once holds one of them twice, and everything that counts what it holds counts
 * the paths a fact arrived by: a verdict names the same thing twice, and whichever of the two the
 * walk met first decides which place a reader is sent to.
 *
 * <p>And the evidence is kept. A fold that answered the count by taking one of the two and dropping
 * the other would be the same loss the other way round — the fact would be one, and where it was
 * met would be wherever the walk got to first.
