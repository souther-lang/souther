/**
 * A module's declarations are written into the classes it publishes and into nothing else.
 *
 * <p>They are there so that another compilation can import the module from a jar without its
 * source, so they are written down as the author wrote them — a declaration's own text, comments
 * and all. That makes them move when nothing about the program does, which is the whole reason the
 * classes an evaluation runs against must not carry them: a row of a module would otherwise be
 * something to establish again whenever anybody typed a comment near a declaration it names.
 *
 * <p>Which is a claim about two artifacts and not about a speed, so it is asked as one. What ships
 * carries the declarations and reads back; what runs carries none of that and the rows still hold.
 * What a class does is the program either way — what only one of them carries is the declaration
 * written down for somebody to read.
