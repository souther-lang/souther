/**
 * A case of an input and the class of its position are one obligation where the behavior has that
 * position, and a case of a behavior that has none is owed at itself.
 *
 * <p>Two derivations meet at one entry while both are about one behavior's own position: the
 * signature counts the cases a row applies the behavior to, and the partition counts the classes a
 * row sits in. A {@code >->} composition takes what its first stage takes and is read there, so it
 * has cases and no positions — and the classes that stage divides are that stage's, covered by that
 * stage's rows.
 *
 * <p>Which is why the account may not key one there, and why the account has to hold an entry of
 * its own for it: a finding names what a row is owed at, and a consumer joins the two by that name.
 * Keyed at the stage, the finding would name another behavior's entry; keyed at nothing published,
 * it would leave the consumer to rebuild the identity by searching the signature — the same
 * rebuilding somewhere other than where the obligation is.
