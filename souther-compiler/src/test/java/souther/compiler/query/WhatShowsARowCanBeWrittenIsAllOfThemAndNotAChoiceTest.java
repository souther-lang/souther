/**
 * What has shown a row can be written at a point is every ground that holds, and never one of them.
 *
 * <p>The three grounds are not alternatives. The rules can prove a point inhabited and a row can be
 * at it and a value can have been built there, all at once, and a verdict that named one of them
 * named whichever an order put first — so a point the rules prove came back saying a row was found
 * there, and the claim that stands whatever a search afterwards makes of the point was the one left
 * out. Holding all of them there is nothing to leave out, and the order they are said in is one
 * written down rather than one this has to invent.
 *
 * <p>Nothing here is stored. Each ground is read off the answer that establishes it — the coverage
 * measurement, the projection, the attempt — so a point cannot carry a ground the facts beside it do
 * not support, and the correspondence is not something a test has to watch.
