/**
 * A value defined in terms of itself is refused once, by one owner, at the name it was declared under.
 *
 * <p>Which value reaches which is a fact about the module, asked and answered once. It used to be
 * worked out again by everything that built an expansion table — a body being lowered, a signature
 * being read, a module being checked — and each of those threw the refusal from wherever it happened
 * to be standing. So which question reported it, and how many of them did, was decided by the order
 * the questions happened to run in rather than by anything about the module.
 *
 * <p>Both halves are stated here because either can regress on its own. A second, unrelated mistake
 * must not change the first report: if the cycle is refused from inside a question the second mistake
 * also reaches, the two are answered as one and the reader is told about the wrong one.
