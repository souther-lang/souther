/**
 * What a measure could not read is not a fact about what the model says.
 *
 * <p>{@code NotApplicable} is the strongest thing a measure says: the model was read to the end and
 * holds no subject for this measure, so no row anybody writes would give it one. A measure that
 * introduces one from an empty collection is making that claim without the reading behind it — and
 * an empty collection is what a derivation that did not come back leaves.
 *
 * <p>The arm measure did it twice over. Which behaviors have a body was read off the elaborated
 * bodies and what each owes was read off the plan, which is itself read off them; a module the
 * compile stopped in has neither, so every behavior in it was answered "this behavior has no body"
 * — on a report whose line above said {@code implemented} (issue #996).
 *
 * <p>What holds the fix is that both directions are here. A derivation that is absent must not
 * produce an inapplicable answer, and a model that genuinely has no subject must still get one:
 * the correction is worthless if it turns every settled nothing into a doubt.
