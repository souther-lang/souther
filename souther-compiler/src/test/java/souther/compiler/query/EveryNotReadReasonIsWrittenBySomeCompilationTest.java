/**
 * Every reason this compiler may write in a document's {@code notRead} is one a compilation of it
 * writes there.
 *
 * <p>A published word is a promise to a reader that there is a state of the model this compiler
 * answers with it. Nothing else here holds that promise: the writer and the schema are held to each
 * other, and two sides agreeing about a shape neither has been asked to produce agree about
 * anything — a word can be spelled the same in both and name a state no compilation reaches, and
 * every sentence written about it goes on being written with nothing to check it against.
 *
 * <p><b>Against a document and not against the stage that decides.</b> A stage answering with the
 * reason is what its own test says; whether the answer survives the projection to the published
 * vocabulary and the writer is what this says, and those are the two edges a word travels that
 * nothing else was reading.
 *
 * <p><b>Total over what this compiler can write, by the machine and not by a list beside it.</b> A
 * word added to {@link UndividedPosition.Reason} arrives here as a word with no model, which is the
 * question being asked of whoever added it. There is no arm for a word nobody can reach: a reason
 * nothing produces is one to take out of the vocabulary or to give a way in, and an entry saying so
 * would make this test agree that a promise need not be kept.
 *
 * <p><b>Which is narrower than what the schema admits, by one word.</b> The field's vocabulary out
 * there also holds the walk stopping after a count of steps, which nothing writes any more and
 * which no reason of this compiler projects to — a word documents of this version carry because
 * they were written before it stopped being written, kept and accounted for where the two surfaces
 * are held to their own producers
 * ({@code WhatEachWayOfDrawingNoLineLeavesIsWrittenDownOnceTest}). Enumerated here as well, it
 * would arrive as a word owed a model no compilation can make — and the arm that would let it pass
 * is the one this has none of.
 *
 * <p><b>Named for the field and not for what the field is called.</b> {@code notRead} is the
 * document's word and it is wider than the word: a rule read from end to end that draws no line is
 * written there too, and nothing in this compiler calls such a rule one it could not read
 * ({@link PartitionEvidence.NotRead}). So what these models are held to reach is the field, and a
 * name saying "unread" would fold a distinction the reasons themselves are split by — a reading
 * that stopped and a rule read to the end are separate capabilities of {@link BlockReason}, and
 * having been one is what that split was made after.
 *
 * <p><b>A model here need not compile without a diagnostic.</b> What is claimed is that a
 * compilation writes the word, and this compiler writes an adequacy document about a model it has
 * something to say against — a declaration nothing can construct and a clause the front end could
 * not type are both such models, and the words for them are among what these are here to reach.
 *
 * <p>A word arriving in the vocabulary leaves the schema's version where it was, and the schema
 * says why in its own words: a word added to an enumerated field is one no earlier document
 * carried, so a document written before it existed is still a document of this version. So what an
 * arrival owes is a model here, and not a version.
