/**
 * Two things can say which file a report is anchored in — filed under, and quoted from — and they
 * are asked in one order. This states that order, so it is a contract rather than whatever the
 * implementation happens to do.
 *
 * <p>A key says which input was asked about. A position says where the caret sits — and the line
 * under the caret is quoted out of the file the report is filed under, so where the two disagree,
 * answering with the key's shows a reader a line they did not write. A question asked about a module
 * whose rows were written in an attached {@code examples for} file is where the two do disagree: it
 * can only answer with the module's own file, and the rows are somewhere else. So the position comes
 * first.
 *
 * <p>Two and not three. A report could once name its own file as well, ahead of both — and the two
 * sites that did read that name off a value that held it beside the place, so what they named was
 * the position's answer written somewhere else. A third tier that can only agree with the second is
 * a tier that can disagree with it.
 *
 * <p>Only the anchor. Whether the problem is also written in some other file is a claim about the
 * regions the report points at, which the check that found it makes and neither of these can —
 * {@link AFindingIsSaidWhereItBelongsNotWhereItPointsTest} is where that is stated.
