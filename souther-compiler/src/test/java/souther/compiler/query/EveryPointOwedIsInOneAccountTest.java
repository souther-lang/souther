/**
 * Every point a row is owed at is in one account, and the two accounts are made from the readings.
 *
 * <p>A border owes a row at up to four points, and whose it is to write one there is settled per
 * point: a run that stops at this body's own rule exists in this body and nowhere else, and a line a
 * {@code data} clause drew is answered once for the module by a row written for any behavior
 * carrying the type. So the readings refine into two accounts, and this holds them to it — a point
 * in both would be a row asked for twice, and a point in neither would be one nothing measures.
 *
 * <p><b>Counting is not the check.</b> The declarations' side collapses every reading of one point
 * into one debt, so the number of debts is smaller than the number of readings that owe them and no
 * total is conserved. What holds is the refinement: each reading's point goes to exactly one side,
 * and each debt is what some readings on the declarations' side came to together.
