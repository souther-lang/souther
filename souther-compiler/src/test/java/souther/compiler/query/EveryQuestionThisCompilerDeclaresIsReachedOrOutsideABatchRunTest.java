/**
 * Every question this compiler declares is one a run over the corpus reaches, or one written down as
 * outside a run — for want of the input it takes, or for want of anything that reads its answer.
 *
 * <p>A question nobody asks is a question nothing checks. What is kept in an answer, whether two
 * compiles of one source answer alike, what a report says — every one of those is held against the
 * answers a run happens to produce, so a family of questions no run reaches is outside all of it and
 * says so nowhere. That is not something the checks themselves can notice: they compare what they
 * found with what is written down, and both are silent about a question that was never put.
 *
 * <p>So the vocabulary is closed from both ends. What the compiler declares is read off the compiled
 * classes rather than off a list somebody maintains — a list is a second truth, and the day a key is
 * added and not registered is the day it says the coverage is whole. What a run reaches is the union
 * of what this project's own operations ask for. Between them:
 *
 * <pre>declared = reached ⊎ what a batch run has no input for ⊎ what no batch result reads</pre>
 *
 * <p>and the union is disjoint, so a question written down as outside a run that a run turns out to
 * reach is a failure as much as one in neither.
 *
 * <p>Two ways of being outside a run and not one, because they are refuted by different things. The
 * first is refuted by a corpus: write a source that puts a cursor somewhere and the question becomes
 * askable. The second is refuted by a consumer: the input has been there all along, and what is
 * missing is anything in a batch result that depends on the answer. Held as one set, a question of
 * the second kind would be excused by a sentence written about the first, which is true of none of
 * them.
 *
 * <p><b>Operations and not questions.</b> What is run below is what this project does — analyse and
 * report, offer rows, ask what a module declares, build at the level a build measures at. Which
 * questions that reaches is the consequence. Written the other way round, with a fixture per key,
 * the suite would be a list of stimuli invented to reach a list, and a question added to one of these
 * operations would arrive uncovered while the arithmetic still added up.
