/**
 * What a build refuses over is what settled the arm, not what the measure over every arm went
 * without.
 *
 * <p>A finding carries the measurement behind it, and a build refuses over the ones nothing
 * weakened: a gap a measure established is work to do, and a gap from a measure that could not be
 * finished is a question. Which measurement is behind an arm no row goes through is the reading of
 * the rows against that arm — and handed the branch measure instead, an arm the rows certainly do
 * not reach stopped being refused over because a fork elsewhere in the body stood for a number of
 * rules nothing established. The arms were still named; a build held to them let them through.
 *
 * <p>Built here rather than compiled from a model. A fork whose rule is chosen while it runs is
 * written in this language and is the case this is about, and its rows cannot be read at all — the
 * arms come back unavailable, so no compile reaches an account holding one. What the account does
 * with such an arm is settled where the account is made, and this is that seam.
