/**
 * Filling what the block offers for a rule settles it, and nothing offers it again.
 *
 * <p>The one law that says the surfaces are readings of one account. Each of the others holds one
 * step of it — that a rule no row takes is reported, that a row is offered against it, that a row
 * taking it discharges it — and every one of them can hold while the ends disagree: a person filling
 * everything the block offers, asking again and being offered nothing further, with the verdict
 * where it was.
 *
 * <p>So this walks the whole of it on one model. What is held is not the wording of any step but
 * that the steps meet: the rule the report names is the rule the block offers a row for, the row
 * written from it takes that rule, and the account then says so.
