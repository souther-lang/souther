/**
 * What a store is left holding when the walk over it was told to stop.
 *
 * <p>Two halves, and each is worth nothing without the other. The question the walk was inside when
 * it stopped never returned a value, so nothing may be kept for it: a store that kept one would hand
 * the next asker an answer that was never worked out. The questions that did return a value inside
 * it are answers of the revision they were asked at, and being told to stop is not an input moving —
 * nothing can move an input while a walk is running, because the walk is what the one thread holding
 * the store is doing. Those are kept, and the walk that follows pays only for what this one left.
 *
 * <p>Counting both is what makes this say anything. A store that threw everything away would satisfy
 * the first half on its own, and one that kept everything would satisfy the second.
 *
 * <p>And a walk is not only what a question is worked out by. An edit moves the revision, and what
 * the next question does with a graph nothing else touched is walk all of it to find that out — no
 * answer is worked out anywhere, and that walk is most of what an editor's store does. A stop that
 * only reached the working-out would be a stop that never came where it was most wanted.
