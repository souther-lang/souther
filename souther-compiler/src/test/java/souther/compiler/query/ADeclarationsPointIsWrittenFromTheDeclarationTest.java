/**
 * A point a declaration owes is written from the declaration, and two readings naming their
 * positions differently is an ordinary thing for a model to do.
 *
 * <p>A line an {@code invariant} drew is owed once for the module and read at every position the
 * type reaches. Where the type is a case of a sum, one behavior takes the case and another takes
 * the sum, so the same line is met at {@code x.leaveFrom} and at {@code x@Onl.leaveFrom} — two
 * paths for one place, which is what a sum is.
 *
 * <p>The sentence for the point used to be settled by writing it at every reading and refusing
 * where two of them differed. They differ exactly where the answer is a reading's: a line between
 * two positions writes its level as a distance from the other position, whose name is the path a
 * walk reached it by. So the refusal fired on a model that is written correctly, and what it
 * refused to write was a sentence nothing could have written — the declaration keeps no name for
 * the pair, because a rule relating two positions places no end (ADR-0090).
 *
 * <p>Which makes the agreement of two readings the wrong question. What a debt may be written from
 * is what the declaration retains, and whether it retains a quantity is
 * {@link souther.compiler.partition.BorderQuantity#statesADeclarationRelativeLevel}'s answer — known
 * without asking a reading at all (issue #1251).
