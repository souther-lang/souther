/**
 * What a module is made of is not all written in one file. An attached {@code examples for} file's
 * rows, tables and values join the module they are for, and a question asked of the module reads all
 * of them — so one line and column is two places, and an editor asking about one of them was
 * answered about whichever the merge happened to reach first.
 *
 * <p>The consequence in an editor is that go-to-definition, hover and rename describe a name the
 * cursor is not on. Same defect as issue #309, one layer over: a coordinate treated as a place.
 *
 * <p>The two files here are built so that line 8 column 14 is a name in each, and the two names
 * denote different values — otherwise a wrong answer would still look right.
