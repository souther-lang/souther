/**
 * A reading that could not hold what it read together says so in the document, under its own word.
 *
 * <p>Issue #877, at the surface a consumer reads. What is owed there is not that something went
 * unread — every rule about the position arrived and every one was taken in — but that the values
 * the document prints for the position may be wider than the rules leave it, so a class made out of
 * them may be one no value can be in.
 *
 * <p>Under its own {@code kind} and not among what a reading did not read. Told apart there, a
 * consumer grouping by kind counts a limit an author can go looking for a clause behind, and there
 * is no clause: the two would be one number and the sentence beside it would be false of half of
 * them.
