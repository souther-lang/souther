/**
 * A combination of two classes is not a thing a row is owed at.
 *
 * <p>What the pair space counts is how much of the model's own product the rows happen to reach.
 * Nothing asks for a row at a combination and nothing offers one: a row composed for a pair moves
 * two positions at once and says nothing about which of them the answer turned on, which is what
 * issue #967 settled. So a count of combinations no row reaches is not work anybody is behind on,
 * and the report says so beside it.
 *
 * <p><b>This is what makes that sentence true.</b> A report saying nothing is owed on the strength
 * of a formatter's reading would go on saying it the day a finding about a combination was added.
 * What holds it is that no gap this compiler can find is about one: the vocabulary of findings has
 * no arm for a combination, and the offering of rows answers every arm it has.
 *
 * <p>So a change that gave a combination a finding fails here rather than in a formatter, and
 * whoever makes it is asked the question this test is named for. Answering it is allowed — the
 * decision is #967's and may be revisited — but it is a change to what a row is owed at, and this
 * says so out loud.
