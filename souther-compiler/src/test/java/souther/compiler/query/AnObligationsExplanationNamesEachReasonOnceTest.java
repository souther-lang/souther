/**
 * What an obligation nobody can decide says about itself, and what it leaves to the readings.
 *
 * <p>One line is read at every position that carries the type, each reading is measured on its own,
 * and what weakened the measurement is keyed on the border the reading was made at — one fact per
 * line a module could not read, which is what a module's account of itself counts. The explanation
 * of one point is the other question about the same readings, and the border is no part of its
 * answer: the readings are named under the point, one to a line, so a clause said once per reading
 * counts the paths a fact arrived by (spec §an-obligations-explanation-names-each-distinct-reason-once).
 *
 * <p>So the crossing from one to the other is what these hold to. The same reason met at any number
 * of readings is one reason; two readings stopped in two ways are two; and neither which border a
 * reading was made at nor the order the readings were walked in reaches the answer.
