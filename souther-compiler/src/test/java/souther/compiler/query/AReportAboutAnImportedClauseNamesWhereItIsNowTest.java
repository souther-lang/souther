/**
 * A report that names a clause of another module names where that clause is now.
 *
 * <p>A body constructing a value of an imported type is judged against the invariant that type
 * declares, and what it is told points at the clause — in the declaring module's source, not in its
 * own. So the reader is one module's and the place is another's, and nothing about the reader
 * changed when the clause moved.
 *
 * <p>Held against a compile of the same text rather than against a line number written down here. A
 * number would say where the clause is in this fixture and would be edited whenever the fixture was;
 * what is being asked is whether a store that absorbed the edit says what a store that never saw the
 * old text says, which is a question about the two and not about either.
