/**
 * A module's own helper is the same expansion in both readings of one body.
 *
 * <p>A body is read two ways. The tree a backend emits has the language's own operations expanded
 * into what they do; the tree an analysis reads has them standing. So one of the two expands strictly
 * more, and anything an expansion is named by that counts what a walk met would name the helper they
 * share differently in each — which is a fact about which reading is being looked at, offered as a
 * fact about the model.
 *
 * <p>So the two are compared — over what both of them hold. The model under test writes a call of
 * the language's own operations and hands its helper to one of them, so the helper stands twice: at
 * a call both readings have, and inside an operation's own body, which only one of them has.
 *
 * <p><b>What is held is not that the two trees are alike.</b> An expansion is what a copy of a body
 * actually is in the reading it stands in, and one reading has a subtree the other has not — so the
 * helper handed to an operation is somewhere else there, and saying otherwise would be a copy tree
 * describing a tree that is not the one it is in. What may not move is what both readings hold: a
 * call the author wrote is the same expansion in each.
