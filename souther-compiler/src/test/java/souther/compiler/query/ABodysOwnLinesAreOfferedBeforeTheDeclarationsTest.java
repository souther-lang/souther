 * A block offers what a body's own lines are owed before what the declarations' are.
 *
 * <p>An order, and it decides what a person is handed. Two rows can answer one point — a value
 * inside a run is inside it whichever line put it there — and the reduction keeps the earlier of
 * them, so that an edit further down the model does not move what is offered above it
 * ({@link Settlements#keeping}).
 *
 * <p>One account answers for both kinds of line, so the order is what
 * {@link BorderAccount#rowsByCarrier} lists them in rather than the order the points were gathered
 * in — which is a fact about a walk and about nothing a reader can see.
