/**
 * What a behavior calls its inputs and what those inputs can arrive as are two answers.
 *
 * <p>Renaming a parameter changes the declaration and changes nothing about what crosses the
 * boundary. A reader that asked what an input is called — an editor writing a hint, a reading that
 * names a position — has a different answer afterwards; a reader that asked what a stage routes or
 * what a codec is built for has the same one, and the question it asked is where that is decided
 * rather than at each of those readers.
 *
 * <p>What a module publishes is not on the second side of that, and the reading below says so
 * rather than leaving it to be assumed: an artifact carries the declaration as its author wrote it,
 * so the name is in what an importing compilation reads back and admits for itself.
