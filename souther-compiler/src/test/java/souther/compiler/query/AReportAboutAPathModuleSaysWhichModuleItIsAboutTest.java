/**
 * A report this compilation makes about a module off the class path says which module the code is
 * in, before anything moves it.
 *
 * <p>Both of these used to be built with nothing said about where their code was, and the caret was
 * put on an import line afterwards by the walk that found them ({@code Front.saidAbout}). A report
 * that says nothing may be moved anywhere: {@link Diagnostic#reachedFrom} has one state where it
 * takes the caller's word for where the code is, and that is the state where nothing contradicts it.
 * So the walk was the only thing keeping the module a report is about and the module it is moved as
 * belonging to the same module, and nothing said so.
 *
 * <p>Saying it at the producer puts the two under one check. What is measured here is that the
 * producers say it — not that the walk still works, which the compile-level tests measure — because
 * a producer that went back to saying nothing would leave those green.
