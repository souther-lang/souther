 * address as a sum changes the form and leaves this alone, because a sum is no more one value wearing
 * a name than a product was. Answered together as one four-valued form, every reader that only asks
 * this would be worked out again by that edit — and there are more of those than of any other
 * question a reader asks about somebody else's declaration.
 *
 * <p>What it wraps is not this question. That is the type its one field was written as, which takes
 * the names in the declaration resolving, and nothing here reads it.
