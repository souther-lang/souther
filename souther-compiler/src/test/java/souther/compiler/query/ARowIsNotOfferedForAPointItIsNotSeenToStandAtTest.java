/**
 * A gap in what the walk can say about the way costs rows, and never costs the truth about them.
 *
 * <p>The two halves of this are asymmetric on purpose, and the asymmetry is the design. What a
 * search composes a row against is however much of the way to the border this reading could state;
 * what says a row is a row for the point is the walk that reads any row at a point. So a condition
 * on the way that nothing could state makes rows harder to compose — and cannot make a row that
 * does not stand at a point be offered for it.
 *
 * <p>Held against a condition this reading declines rather than one it takes in, because that is the
 * case the second half exists for. A model whose way is understood composes a row that reaches and
 * the walk agrees with it; the run worth writing down is the one where the composer was told
 * nothing and guessed.
 *
 * <p>This is the test that goes on holding when a fork nothing here has learned to read arrives in
 * the language. What such a fork takes away is rows. What it may not take away is that an offered
 * row is one nothing saw standing somewhere else.
