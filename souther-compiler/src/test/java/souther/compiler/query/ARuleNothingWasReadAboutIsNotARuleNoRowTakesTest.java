 * <p>Two nothings, and the account may refuse over one of them. A behavior nobody wrote a row for
 * has its rules uncovered and an author writes a row; a behavior whose rows nothing could be read
 * of has rules nothing was read about, and a row taking one of them may be sitting in the file the
 * reading could not evaluate. Told as one, a build is refused over rules an author has already
 * written rows for.
 *
 * <p>Which is why the coverage half of the account is a measure. The four states a measurement has
 * are the four answers here — nobody asked, there was nothing to read, it was read in part, it was
 * read whole — and a sum of its own had one word for the first three with nothing behind it to say
 * a finding may not be refused over.
