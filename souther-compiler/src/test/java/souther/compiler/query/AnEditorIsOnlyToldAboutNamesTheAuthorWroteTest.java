/**
 * The resolve pass gives a binding to more than the names an author wrote. A desugaring binds what
 * it is rewriting to a name of its own — the parameter {@code .field} becomes, the value a
 * {@code match} is held in — and anchors it on the form it came from, which is a place in the source
 * holding something the author did write.
 *
 * <p>Answering a cursor there with one of those would name a binding that is not in the file, at a
 * width that is not its. Renaming from it would then write over whatever is at that place: the
 * getter {@code .v} is three characters wide as `$g0`, and the three characters at its position are
 * `.v,`.
 *
 * <p>The other half is a binding whose name the author did write but whose uses this pass does not
 * record. A field is one: {@code d.v} and {@code D { v = ... }} are resolved by the type of what
 * they are read from, not by what is in scope, and only the ones inside an {@code invariant} come
 * through here. A rename answered from those would rewrite the declaration and leave every read.
