/**
 * A position says which source it was read from, and that source is not always one this compile has.
 * The prelude and a module read back off the module path are both read somewhere else, and a caller
 * can hand over any set of files it likes.
 *
 * <p>What is guarded here is availability as much as attribution. A report filed under a name
 * {@link Compilation#diagnostics()} has no entry for is dropped on the floor, and a problem the
 * author never sees is worse than one shown against the wrong file. So a claim this compile cannot
 * honour falls back to the module's own source rather than being taken at its word.
