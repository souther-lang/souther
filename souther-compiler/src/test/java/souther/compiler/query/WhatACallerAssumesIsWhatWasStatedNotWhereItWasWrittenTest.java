/**
 * What a caller depends on of a contract is what it states, over every contract the conformance
 * corpus writes.
 *
 * <p>A contract is read into terms, and a term carries where it was written and the ordinal its
 * module numbered it with. Neither is anything a caller reads — it substitutes its own arguments in
 * and reads what the terms say — so two readings of one declaration that differ only in where the
 * file put it are the same dependency. {@link StatedContract#assumptions()} is where that is
 * decided, and {@link souther.compiler.check.TermMeaning} is what it decides with.
 *
 * <p>This asks it of {@link Bodies.Assumptions}, over what the corpus states. It does not ask it of
 * every kind of term: the corpus states one {@code ensures}, which reaches a handful of the node
 * kinds a reading is projected over, and a kind whose place was compared in a shape this never
 * meets would pass here. That is {@code EveryTermIsReadForWhatItSaysTest}, which asks the same
 * question of one node kind at a time, and
 * {@code EveryKindOfTermACorpusWritesIsReadForWhatItSaysTest}, which reports the kinds nothing
 * reaches. All three are wanted: one holds the projection, one holds what a model writes, and this
 * holds what the query graph does with it.
 *
 * <p>Moving the whole file is the edit: every position in it changes, and every construct is
 * numbered after the ones the blank lines did not add, so a place surviving anywhere in a contract
 * shows up here as an inequality.
