 * <p>A clause of a {@code data} settles a question about the type: whether a string of one character
 * is a {@code Sku} is the same question wherever a {@code Sku} goes, and a row standing there answers
 * it for everybody. So the module that wrote the clause owes the row, and a module importing the type
 * owes nothing — asked for it, four of the five modules carrying a type are asked for work they cannot
 * do and cannot check.
 *
 * <p>The other side of the same rule is that the evidence stays where the debt is. A row written in an
 * importer is a row of that module, and reading it here would make a module's account of its own
 * declarations move when a module it has never heard of is added to the compile.
