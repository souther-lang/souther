 * <p>Three absences meet on one behavior and they are three different things. The signature is an
 * analysis saying what it could not work out, and it is right to have no entry. The measures of
 * that behavior are asked for and started and cannot finish, so each of them is a measurement with
 * no number that says what it went without. And the reading of what the model divides the behavior
 * into is never asked for, because the measure that would ask has already answered.
 *
 * <p>Read as one they are not distinguishable: a behavior left out of a measure's map reads to one
 * reader as this compiler disagreeing with itself and to another as a measure nobody asked for, and
 * a measure nobody asked for goes without nothing — so a behavior nothing could be established
 * about is held to no bar at all and says nothing about it.
