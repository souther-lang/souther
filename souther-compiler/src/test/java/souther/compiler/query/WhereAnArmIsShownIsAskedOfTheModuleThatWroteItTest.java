/**
 * A fork one module writes stands in every module that calls into it, and where it is written is
 * the writing module's answer rather than something each copy carries.
 *
 * <p>What crosses the boundary is which fork it is. A report about one of its arms points into the
 * file the fork is written in, which is a second question — so moving that file moves the caret and
 * leaves the arm the caller is holding exactly as it was. Carried on the arm, the same edit would
 * arrive at the caller as a fork that says something different, and nothing about what either
 * module says would have changed.
