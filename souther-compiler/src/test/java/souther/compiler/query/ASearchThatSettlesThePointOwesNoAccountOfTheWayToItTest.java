/**
 * What a search left unaccounted for is asked of the search, and a search that settled the point
 * left nothing.
 *
 * <p>A walk of the whole of what the rules leave that reaches no value proves there is nothing to
 * find, and it proves it whether or not the box it walked held rows that never arrive:
 *
 * <pre>what reaches the point ⊆ the region searched, and the region searched is empty</pre>
 *
 * <p>so what reaches the point is empty as well. A condition on the way that nothing represented in
 * that region takes nothing away from the proof, and telling an author about it there would send
 * them looking for a row the model has already been shown not to hold.
 *
 * <p>Held here rather than against a report. Two outcomes of one search differ only in what the
 * search came to, and no pair of models produces that pair: a condition a reading takes in narrows
 * the region and draws a line of its own, so the two sides of a model-level comparison differ in
 * more than the thing under test. At this end the way is held still and the outcome varied, which is
 * the comparison the rule is about.
 *
 * <p>No region is built here, and that is the shape of the thing rather than an economy. What an
 * outcome carries is the account of the way to the point; where a row was looked for is worked out
 * from that account by whoever is looking, and a search that has finished is not.
