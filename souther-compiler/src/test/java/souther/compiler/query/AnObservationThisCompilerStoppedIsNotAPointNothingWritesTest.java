/**
 * A rule whose values this compilation could not read whole still owes the rows it owes.

 * <p>How much of a value an observation keeps is a policy about what an answer may hold. It decides
 * nothing about the model, so the account of what an author owes is the same account whether or not
 * the walk that reads a row got to the end of it: the same rule is written, the same four points
 * are on its line, and what changes is only whether anybody can say a row is at one of them.
 *
 * <p><b>Held over the length of the reading, and not against one model.</b> A name standing for
 * another is the one thing a model may have any number of, so a wrapper added is not a statement
 * about anything — and every number an observation could stop at is a model somebody may write.
 * A regression for the model that was reported would go green again under a larger budget; this
 * would not.
