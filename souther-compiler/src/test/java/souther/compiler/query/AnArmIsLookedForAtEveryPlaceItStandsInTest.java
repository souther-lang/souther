/**
 * A row is looked for at every place an arm stands in the body, not at one of them.
 *
 * <p>A non-recursive helper is spliced into each body that calls it, so one arm the author wrote
 * stands in the running tree once per call site. What steers a row into a splice is what stands on
 * the way to <em>that</em> splice, and two splices of one arm are reached by different ways: a
 * helper called with a value the caller wrote has an arm nothing can steer a row to, and the same
 * helper called with a parameter has one it can.
 *
 * <p>Asked at a single occurrence, the answer was whichever the walk wrote first. The two models
 * below are one body with its call sites swapped — the same arms, the same ways in, the same rows —
 * and one of them was offered a row for the arm while the other was told nothing could steer one
 * along it.
 *
 * <p>Held as the two answers agreeing rather than as one expected block. What the block says about
 * the rest of the model is not this test's, and an assertion over the whole of it would fail for
 * every change to any of it.
