/**
 * Everything a store holds means something by {@code equals}, and what does not is written down.
 *
 * <p>What an edit costs rests on an answer that means what the last one meant coming out equal to
 * it. One object under an answer that compares by address is enough to lose that: the answer above
 * it can never equal its own recomputation, so every key that read it runs again on every revision
 * over a model nobody edited. Nothing else here sees that happen — every check stays green and every
 * reader of the answer runs forever.
 *
 * <p><b>Both detectors over both scenarios.</b> The two walks see different things and neither is
 * the other's superset, so the register under them is worth what both are worth together. Run over
 * different inputs, a difference between them would be a difference of stimulus as much as of
 * detector, and no reading of the register could tell which. So the scenarios are the axis and the
 * detectors are applied across all of it.
 *
 * <p>The scenarios are two because an answer is two things. {@code Answer} is what a question came
 * to and what the compile said getting there, and {@code Db} compares both — so a corpus of models
 * nothing is said about exercises one half of every answer in the store.
