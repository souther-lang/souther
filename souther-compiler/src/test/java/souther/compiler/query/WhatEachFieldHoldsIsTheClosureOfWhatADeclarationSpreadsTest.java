/**
 * What each field a declaration reaches holds, and what moves it.
 *
 * <p>The closure over what the declaration spreads, answered as one thing: a value of the type is
 * made of the fields its spreads bring in as much as of the ones it writes, and a reader working
 * that out for itself would walk the spread declarations again.
 *
 * <p>What is held beside the closure itself is what it is read off. A field's type moves this and a
 * declaration's place does not, which is the whole of why a module that reads another's fields is
 * left alone by an edit that only moves them.
 *
 * <p>And what it answers is a name to a type, not a sequence of fields. Nothing here holds the
 * order the answer iterates in, because the answer does not state one: two of these that hold the
 * same names for the same types are equal, so a reader that took the order off one would be
 * reading what no edit to that order will ever wake it about. Held below as the edit that does not
 * reach a reader rather than left unsaid, so the day somebody wants the order they find out here
 * that this is not where it is answered.
