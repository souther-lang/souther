/**
 * Where a report is said is read off what it says, and off nothing else.
 *
 * <p>The question a second region answers is whether the diagnostic passes judgment on it too. A
 * rule, a declaration or a definition shown because the primary was judged against it is not
 * somewhere the problem is written, however necessary it is to understanding the problem; two
 * statements that contradict, or the two ends of a relation that may not exist, are, because
 * neither of them is the premise the other is measured by.
 *
 * <p>So none of this turns on which module a compile happens to be walking. The same two regions
 * are the same problem in the same two files whichever of them the question was asked about, and a
 * caret that left its module says nothing about whether the module it landed in is in the wrong.
