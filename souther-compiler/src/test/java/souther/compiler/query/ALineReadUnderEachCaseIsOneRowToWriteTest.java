/**
 * A guard on a name the cases of a sum spread is one row to write, read once under each case.
 *
 * <p>The name is readable at every value of the sum and a row is written under one case, so the line
 * is read as many times as there are cases and every one of those readings asks the same of a row.
 * What is owed is the line's; where it was met is the reading's.
 *
 * <p>So the readings are gathered under the point they are readings of, and a row standing at one of
 * them is the point answered. Counted per reading instead, one guard would be as many rows to write
 * as the sum has cases, and the offer for it — one row, since the point is one — would leave the
 * rest of them permanently unanswered.
