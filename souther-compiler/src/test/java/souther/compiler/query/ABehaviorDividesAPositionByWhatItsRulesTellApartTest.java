/**
 * A behavior that treats some of the strings at a position differently divides that position.
 *
 * <p>The whole of what this issue is about, asked of the compiler rather than of any stage in it. An
 * invariant restricts a position — every value outside it is refused at construction — and a
 * behavior divides one: both sides of what a {@code guard} asks are values the model may hold, and a
 * run is on one side or the other. A position an author wrote such a rule for was coming back
 * undivided, so nothing owed a row on either side.
 *
 * <p>End to end because every stage between was already right about its own part. The rule was read,
 * what it admits was worked out, and the classes were built — from the tree where the operation had
 * been expanded into what it does, so there was no rule there to find. What this holds is the answer,
 * which is the only place all of it shows.
