 * What is known to sit in an answer and not mean anything by {@code equals}, and who sees it.
 *
 * <p>One register for both detectors. They see different things and both are needed — one walks a
 * store and asks each object what it is, the other holds two stores side by side and asks where they
 * come apart — but what a finding <em>is</em>, and which of the two ways out it takes, is one
 * judgement and is made here. Written twice, the two lists drift into two vocabularies for one fact.
 *
 * <p><b>A place and not a class.</b> An entry names the question, where in that answer the thing
 * sits, and what it is. Keyed by the class alone, a class already written down here turning up under
 * some other answer would be waved through as known; keyed by the place, it is a new place the debt
 * has reached and says so.
 *
 * <p><b>Two ways out and no third.</b> {@link Meaning} is what a thing is, and there are two of
 * them: something that says what it is, with what is wrong with how it says it, or something that
 * does something. A word for a thing nobody has read yet would be a third, and it is what let a
 * place stand here twice with no remedy attached — so there is none, and a walk meeting something
 * unread fails until somebody says which of the two it is.
 *
 * <p><b>Where it was seen is not what it is.</b> A finding is one finding however many detectors and
 * however many scenarios meet it, so the detector and the scenario are provenance beside the entry
 * rather than part of what it names. Held inside the identity, one thing seen twice would read as
 * two things — the same mistake as keying by class, from the other side.
