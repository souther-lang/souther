/**
 * A name nothing answered is a name the editor has no answer for.
 *
 * <p>What resolution worked out is what an editor is told, and a name that denotes nothing is not
 * something it worked out. Standing an identity in for the absence — a {@code TypeSymbol} of a
 * declaration nobody wrote, a {@code ValueName} nothing binds — makes the reader's question come
 * back answered, so go-to-definition, find-references and rename each act on a declaration that is
 * not there. Absence is the answer, and a reader that has none falls back to what it can say
 * honestly.
 *
 * <p>Each absence is asserted beside a name written in the same form that did resolve, and both in
 * one test. Held apart, the absence would be the answer a compilation that recorded nothing at all
 * gives — a reader with no facts to consult says nothing either — and the proposition here is the
 * other one: the facts are there, they say what the pass worked out, and they say nothing about
 * what it did not.
