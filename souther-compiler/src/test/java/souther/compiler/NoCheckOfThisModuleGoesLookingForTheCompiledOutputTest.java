/**
 * A check of this module asks {@link WhatWasCompiled} for its classes; it does not go and find them.
 *
 * <p>Where the classes a rule reads are is one question and what they hold is another, and a check
 * that answers the first for itself has taken on a fact about the build. What it takes on is the
 * directory the build happened to be invoked from — so the same check answers differently under a
 * build invoked elsewhere — and, having found the files, it opens them: the same files the check
 * beside it opened, for the fork to read again.
 *
 * <p>What is asked here is which class names an output. Writing down where a build puts what it
 * made is the other way in, and it is refused for every module that reads compiled classes rather
 * than for this one — see {@code NoCheckGoesLookingForACompiledOutputTest} in the architecture
 * tests. What hands the location out is nothing, so those two are the whole of it.
 *
 * <p>What is not refused is reading a class file. This module compiles Souther models and asks what
 * came out of them, and what came out is a value in the test rather than a file anybody went looking
 * for; a rule written over parsing would refuse those as well, and there are many of them.
