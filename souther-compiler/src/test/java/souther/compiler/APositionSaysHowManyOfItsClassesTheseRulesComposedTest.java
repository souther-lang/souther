/**
 * A position divided into more classes than the behavior's rules composed says both numbers.
 *
 * <p>The cases of a sum are classes of the position whether or not a rule of this behavior looks at
 * them. So a behavior may take five cases and decide one two-way question with them: every measure
 * over the position comes back full, and the combinations those classes take part in stay unknown,
 * because no row can reach a combination the model has and the behavior never tells apart. A reader
 * handed that count and nothing else reads it as work owed and writes a row that buys a combination
 * and no evidence.
 *
 * <p><b>The rules that composed the classes, and not the lines the behavior draws.</b> A line is
 * where a row is owed at either side of it; what put a value in a class is the axis's own answer,
 * and the two part exactly where this sentence is about — a sum whose cases nothing compares is
 * divided into classes by nobody's rule and has no line either.
 *
 * <p>Neither number is a finding and no row answers either. Whether to narrow the input, split the
 * behavior, or leave it as a value this one passes through is the author's, and this compiler knows
 * none of it: what it can say is what it worked out.
