/**
 * In the packages that read a program, going on from a failure of the platform is somebody's leave.
 *
 * <p>What an analysis may be quiet about is a limit it named, and a limit is a value something with
 * the standing to say so made. A failure with no such value behind it is this compiler contradicting
 * itself, and the way that goes wrong is silent: a subject the analysis fell over on comes back with
 * nothing to report, which is what a subject that passed comes back as. Nothing fails while it does,
 * which is why a person reading the diff will not find it either.
 *
 * <p><b>What is watched is the way out of a handler, not the catch.</b> Catching widely is ordinary
 * and sometimes the only thing on offer — a class file the JDK refuses to parse, a message the
 * formatter will not take — and most of the ones in these packages end by throwing: the emitter says
 * what it could not read back, the writer says which limit of the class file was reached, a term
 * says which of the values it holds did not answer. None of those turns a failure into an answer.
 * What does is a handler a caller can return through, so that is what this asks: from where the
 * handler begins, following only the edges an ordinary run takes, is there a {@code return} to
 * arrive at.
 *
 * <p><b>And the ones that can are written down one place at a time.</b> Not the wide types — a type
 * is not what earns the right to go on. {@link StackOverflowError} out of a matcher handed a budget
 * is the engine answering that it did not finish inside it, and the same error out of anywhere else
 * is this compiler recursing without end; a licence written against the type would cover both, and
 * the second would be quiet from the day somebody wrote it. So what is granted is a place, and what
 * is written beside it is the question that place put and what an answer to it is
 * ({@link #PLATFORM_QUESTIONS}).
 *
 * <p>That is a list, and it is not the list this was written to avoid. Nothing that throws is in it,
 * however wide it catches, so it is not a copy of where the broad catches are. What it holds is the
 * decisions — the places allowed to turn a host's failure into something this compiler says — and a
 * new one lands here and is read before it is granted.
 *
 * <p>Read off the compiled classes, because what a handler does is a fact about the bytecode. A
 * {@code throw} of a value some other method computed is an {@code athrow} here like any other, and
 * a handler that branches before deciding is walked rather than read off its first instruction.
 *
 * <p><b>Most of what is examined is not written down anywhere.</b> A {@code switch} over a sealed
 * type compiles to a handler catching {@link Throwable} and rethrowing it as a
 * {@link MatchException}, and this compiler is written in those, so they outnumber the handlers a
 * person typed many times over. They are left in rather than recognised: telling them apart means
 * knowing how one version of javac writes them, and there is nothing to be had by it — every one of
 * them ends by throwing, which is the answer this asks for. What it costs is that the population
 * being non-empty no longer says much on its own, which is what the second test below is for.

     * <p>Two things make it wide. Nothing in this build declares it, which is what says this

     * thing. Read off the name, because that is what ownership is: which loader a class arrived
     * through says where it was found, and a library's own runtime exception arrives the same way
     * this compiler's does.
     *
     * <p>And it is an unchecked failure: a {@link RuntimeException} or an {@link Error}, or
     * something above them that takes either in. A checked exception is not one — {@code IOException}
     * is a condition a method declared, and a handler naming it says what it met.
