/**
 * The rules leaving an input no value is proved once, and every measure of that input is
 * inapplicable for it.
 *
 * <p>Two things, and they are at different levels. The proof is one: two clauses each admitting
 * values are empty together, neither of them is the one that failed, and there is no position for it
 * to be about — so it is made where a behavior's parameters are held together, which is the only
 * place such a contradiction is visible at all. What a document carries is per measure: a partition
 * and a border each say they have no subject, in the word this proof spells.
 *
 * <p>So the count below is two and not one. A reading that answered per position or per rule would
 * say it four times or twice over the record here, and one that derived it per measure could let two
 * measures disagree about a model — the fixture has four positions and two clauses so that both of
 * those show.
 *
 * <p>Not a gap. A gap is a row nobody has written and somebody could; here no row exists to write,
 * so a strict build has nothing to refuse over and no author is being asked for anything.
