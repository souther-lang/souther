/**
 * A definition is held to what its own module wrote, and to nothing a row in another module says
 * about it.
 *
 * <p>A helper whose body answers no value — {@code unreachable} on its own — is a definition that
 * can only stand where a position states a type. Inlined into a field, a declared return or an
 * annotated binding it is fine, and its module compiles. What a row does with it is the row's
 * question, and the answer belongs at the row: it is the row that wrote a supply position with
 * nothing to supply.
 *
 * <p>The three ways of reaching it are one reading. A row in the declaring module, a row in an
 * importing module, and the same helper with its return type declared are all the same claim about
 * the same expression, so they are refused for the same reason at the same kind of place. They were
 * three answers: two of them named a line in a file that had done nothing wrong.
