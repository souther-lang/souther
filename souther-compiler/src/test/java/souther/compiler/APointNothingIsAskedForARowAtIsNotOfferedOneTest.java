/**
 * What a run is asked for a row at is not everything a line is owed one at.
 *
 * <p>A point a written row already stands at is owed and is nobody's work: the measurement says so,
 * and the search is gated on the same answer. Held in the offering's items all the same, a candidate
 * standing there would be the only thing offering for it — so nothing could drop that candidate, and
 * it would go out beside the row that made it unnecessary.
 *
 * <p>The declarations say it in their own words. A point resolved as {@code NoSearch} is one nothing
 * was looked for at, and its two causes are a row already standing there and nothing having measured
 * it. Neither is a piece of work this run hands anybody.
