/**
 * What the report says about a position it derived nothing at.
 *
 * <p>Two behaviors differing by three tokens. One compares a position and nothing else; the other
 * compares the same position to the same number with a second comparison in front of it. Both come
 * back with no axis, and the report used to say the same thing about both — that the model draws no
 * line there — which is true of neither, and of the second is the opposite of what the body says
 * two lines above.
 *
 * <p>So the sentence has to name which of the two happened. Not because the wording is nicer: an
 * author reading "the model draws no line here" stops looking, and the row at the line is the one
 * the model most needs.
