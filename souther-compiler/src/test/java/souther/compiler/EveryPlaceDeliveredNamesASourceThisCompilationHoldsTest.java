/**
 * Every place this compilation hands a reader is one of its own sources.
 *
 * <p>The types say this: a citation that offers a position offers one whose placement names a source,
 * and a placement that names none has no position to offer. This says it from the other end — over a
 * compile that reaches out of sight, with the reports and the adequacy document read the way a
 * terminal and a build read them, counting the places that come out and checking each against the
 * sources the compile was handed.
 *
 * <p>Which is not the same claim as the type's. A type says a value cannot be built; this says the
 * values that were built are the ones that reach a reader, and that nothing on the way turned a
 * position that named a source into a report about a file nobody has. The count is what #762 measured
 * of itself and what this issue asked for: delivered places claiming somewhere this compilation does
 * not hold, zero.
 *
 * <p>An assertion over what came out is green when nothing came out. So the walk is measured first —
 * how many places it saw, and that some of them are about code out of sight — and the check is on the
 * same numbers. A fixture that stopped reaching a published module would fail here rather than pass
 * quietly.
