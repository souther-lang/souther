 * <p>Two of the four points of a line name a value and two name a region, and what a report says of
 * each is what it asks a row for. Written the same way, the sentence about a region said a run was
 * one value — {@code String.length(value) = 1 < String.length(value)} — which is a row nobody can
 * write and a sentence nobody can read.
 *
 * <p>Under the declaration and not under a behavior, because a run beside a clause's line stops
 * where the clause leaves the quantity: nothing in a body moved it, so one row anywhere settles it
 * and there is no body to send an author to.
