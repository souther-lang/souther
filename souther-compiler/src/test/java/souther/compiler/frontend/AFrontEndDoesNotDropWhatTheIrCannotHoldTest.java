/**
 * A source construct the IR it is lowered into cannot represent is refused where it is still there.
 *
 * <p>Not a rule about sums. The parser takes an {@code invariant} clause after a declaration of any
 * form, and each form is lowered into a declaration of its own kind; where the kind it reaches has
 * no slot for a clause, the clause has nowhere to go. Reaching that point and carrying on drops what
 * the author wrote, and with it anything wrong inside it — a clause calling a function that does not
 * exist compiles clean.
 *
 * <p>What that costs is not one silent clause. A reading that asks "what rules are written about
 * this position" answers from the IR, so a rule the IR never received reads as a rule nobody wrote,
 * and a report goes on to say the model draws no distinction there. An absence proved from a
 * declaration that lost its rules is not an absence.
 *
 * <p>So the property is written over the declaration kinds rather than over the one that was found
 * to have the hole: writing the clause has to change something. Either the declaration holds it, or
 * a diagnostic appears that was not there without it. The population comes from
 * {@link Hir.Def}'s own permitted subclasses, so a declaration kind added later arrives here with no
 * sample and fails rather than being quietly outside the property.
