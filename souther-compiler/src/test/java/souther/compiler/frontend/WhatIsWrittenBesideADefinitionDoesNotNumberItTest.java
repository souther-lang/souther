/**
 * What a definition is read as does not turn on what was written beside it.
 *
 * <p>Every number the builder hands out is an identity or a name, and both are carried from here to
 * the end: a coverage obligation is the construct it was numbered as, a rule is the block it was
 * numbered as, and a binder a lowering minted is the name it was given. Counted over the file, each
 * of those is a function of everything written before it there — so declaring a helper renumbers
 * every construct after it, an importer that cannot name the helper is handed a declaration that
 * says something new, and the work of a whole module runs again for an edit nothing about it can
 * see.
 *
 * <p>So the property is about pairs of sources rather than about any one of them. Write the same
 * model twice, once with a definition ahead of it that numbers something and once with the same
 * definition numbering one thing more, and every definition the two share must be read the same
 * way. The two probes are one line each, so nothing after them moves and no position has to be
 * passed over to compare what is left.
 *
 * <p>Asked of every model this repository carries. The counters are one shape and there are several
 * of them; a test naming the constructs it thought of would answer about those and leave the next
 * one to be found by an author.

     * The probes, by what the file they go into may hold.
     *
     * <p>Two pairs and not one, because what a definition may be depends on which kind of file it is
     * written in: an {@code examples for} file holds the values its rows name, which are {@code let}s
     * with no parameters, and a definition with one is refused there. A probe that a file refuses is
     * a source the property cannot be asked of, which is the thing this test says out loud rather
     * than passes over.
     *
     * <p>What each pair moves is what a {@code let} of that shape can move. In a model file the
     * pattern parameter takes a name the lowering mints, the lambda is a block and takes a rule
     * number, and the operation takes a construct number; in an attached file, where the lambda
     * would be lifted into a parameter the file refuses, the operation alone. The counters a
     * {@code match}, a tuple pattern, a field getter and a spread move are not written by either,
     * and the count a row is given belongs to an owner no {@code let} is one of —
     * {@code OneOwnerWrittenTwiceIsOneNumberingTest} is where that one is read.
