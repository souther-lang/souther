/**
 * Choosing which handle a document writes asks where a rule is once for each one offered.
 *
 * <p>What it costs to ask is the caller's, not this one's: a report holds the answers it gathered
 * and a lookup is a lookup, while a generator asks the module that wrote the rule and each of those
 * is a question of its own. So the count is the contract, and it is written down here because a
 * fold that reads a projection while it compares reads it as many times as it compares — which is a
 * number that grows with what was offered and looks like nothing on a pair.
