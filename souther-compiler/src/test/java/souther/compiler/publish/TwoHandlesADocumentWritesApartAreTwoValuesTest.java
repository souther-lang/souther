/**
 * Two handles a document writes apart are two values, and two it writes alike are one.
 *
 * <p>What this type is for. Choosing one of several takes a comparison, and a comparison that comes
 * out equal for two handles a reader can tell apart leaves the choice to whichever the set of them
 * iterated first — a document whose sentence turns on the order a walk happened to take.
 *
 * <p>So the property is the one the projection has to keep, in both directions. Two handles that are
 * one value are written the same way, which is what lets either be chosen; two that are written
 * differently are not one value, which is what stops the choice from being arbitrary. A rule's kind
 * is in the sentence, so it is in the projection — left out, a comparison and a rule about the
 * strings at a position written in one place came to one value and were printed two ways.
 *
 * <p>And the order agrees with the equality, because both are asked of the same value. A comparison
 * answering zero where {@code equals} answers false is a pair the sort calls interchangeable and the
 * reader does not.
