/**
 * A place is compared one way wherever this compiler compares places.
 *
 * <p>Two things this document chooses are chosen out of places: which of several a fact is written
 * at, and which of several handles a rule is reached by. Written as two comparisons, the two came
 * apart — a line and a column compared as text put line ten before line nine, while the order over
 * places put line nine first, so one thing had two orders and which a reader saw turned on which
 * question was being asked.
 *
 * <p>So what is asked here is that the two agree, over a pair that tells them apart. A comparison
 * of its own would answer this by being written the same way twice, which is the arrangement this
 * exists to say is not enough.
