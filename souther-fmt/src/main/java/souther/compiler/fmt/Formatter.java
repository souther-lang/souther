     * does. This one group covers both, so it is measured with the union flat and breaks at the
     * parameters; the union is then measured on the line the {@code )} left it, and breaks only
     * where it does not fit there by itself. Two groups would be two decisions and the layout would
     * take whichever it reached with too little room — which is the parameters last, since they are
     * written first.
