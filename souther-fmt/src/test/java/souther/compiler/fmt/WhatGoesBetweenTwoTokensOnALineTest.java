/**
 * What the canonical form writes between two code tokens that share a line, as a function and not as
 * an observation. Three things, in order.
 *
 * <p><b>The range.</b> There is no third answer: whatever the source wrote between two tokens, the
 * canonical form writes nothing or one space. That is where the alignment goes.
 *
 * <p><b>The rule.</b> Which of the two is decided by the construct that joins the tokens — their
 * lowest common ancestor in the tree — together with the kind on each side. Over a corpus that builds
 * every kind of node the grammar has, that key never takes both answers. So the function exists, and
 * this is what it reads.
 *
 * <p><b>Where the construct is load-bearing.</b> For all but nine pairs of token kinds the answer is
 * the same from every construct that can join them, so the pair alone decides. Those nine are written
 * out with each construct's answer, and the rest with theirs — the whole function is transcribed,
 * because it does not compress. Grouping the kinds into words, brackets, commas, dots and operators
 * leaves eight of the twenty-four class pairs taking both answers, and splitting the classes far
 * enough to fix that arrives back at the kind. So the table is the rule, and a pair reaching the
 * corpus that no row holds fails: a new adjacency is a decision, and it is made here rather than by
 * whichever construct writes it first.
 *
 * <p>The corpus is not a sample of Souther. It is a set of sources chosen so that every node kind in
 * {@link SyntaxKind} is built at least once, and that is asserted — a kind added to the grammar
 * without a source here fails rather than going unmeasured.
