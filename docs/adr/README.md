# Architecture Decision Records

This directory records the decisions behind Souther's design — the reasoning, the
alternatives weighed, and the prior art consulted. The language specification
([`../../specification.adoc`](../../specification.adoc)) states *what* the language does;
these ADRs state *why*.

Referencing is one-directional: each ADR points back to the spec sections whose
rationale it holds, but the specification itself does not link to ADRs — it states
the rules and examples, nothing more.

Format: [Nygard-style](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions)
(Status / Context / Decision / Consequences). ADRs are written in English; the
specification is in Japanese.

| [0013](0013-sum-cases-are-named-data-references.md) | Sum-data cases are references to already-declared named data | `[#sum-data]` |
| [0014](0014-explicit-newtype-syntax.md) | newtype is declared explicitly by `data X = Y`, not inferred from shape | `[#newtype]` |
| [0015](0015-cross-module-field-read-construction-closed.md) | Field reads may cross module boundaries; only construction is closed | `[#field-visibility]`, `[#jvm-product]` |
| [0016](0016-requirements-as-arguments-not-effects.md) | The requirement set is injected constructor arguments, not an effect type | `[#blocks]`, `[#requires]`, `[#requirement-propagation]`, `[#core-semantics]` |
| [0017](0017-declare-dont-infer-permissions-and-requirements.md) | Declare, don't infer: requirements and composed output; construction permission is optional | `[#constructs]`, `[#requires]`, `[#declared-composition-output]` |
| [0018](0018-no-dedicated-update-syntax.md) | No dedicated update syntax; use a named record literal with spread | `[#record-literal]` |
| [0019](0019-one-arrow-for-types-and-terms.md) | One arrow `->` for types and terms (lambdas, match); `=` binds names | `[#delimiters]`, `[#fn-declaration]`, `[#match]` |

| [0021](0021-compiler-layers-core-ir.md) | Compiler layers — a Core IR between type-checking and code generation | `[#compiler-pipeline]`, `[#ast-tracking]` |

| [0025](0025-first-class-functions.md) | First-class functions: inline when they can't escape, close over the runtime `Fn` when they must | `[#blocks]`, `[#fn-declaration]`, `[#stdlib-list]` |
| [0026](0026-signatures-colon-definitions-equals.md) | Signatures use `:`, definitions use `=`; a function is defined with `let` | `[#delimiters]`, `[#behavior]`, `[#fn]` |
| [0027](0027-match-with-pipe-cases.md) | match reads `match e with \| case -> ...` (F# form) | `[#match]` |
| [0028](0028-stdlib-privileged-core-over-intrinsic-kernel.md) | The stdlib is a privileged core written in Souther over an intrinsic kernel | `[#stdlib]`, `[#primitives]` |
| [0029](0029-platform-failures-are-exceptions-not-cases.md) | Platform failures propagate as exceptions; only domain outcomes are cases | `[#java-impl-rules]`, `[#out-of-scope]` |
| [0030](0030-spread-not-include-keyword.md) | Record composition and update use a `...` spread, not an `include` keyword | `[#product-data]`, `[#field-spread]`, `[#record-literal]` |
| [0031](0031-invariant-follows-the-type-body.md) | A data's `invariant` clause follows the type body, not the record's braces | `[#invariant]`, `[#product-data]` |
| [0032](0032-newtype-constructor-parenthesized.md) | A newtype is constructed by applying its name, parenthesized: `金額(500)` | `[#newtype]`, `[#violation-destination]` |
| [0033](0033-numeric-literals-and-arithmetic-operators.md) | Decimal literals carry an `m` suffix; `+ - * /` work on Int and Decimal | `[#primitives]`, `[#stdlib-int]`, `[#stdlib-decimal]` |
| [0034](0034-value-pipe-and-argument-order.md) | The value pipe `\|>` threads a value through calls; the stdlib takes its main object last | `[#pipe]`, `[#stdlib]`, `[#delimiters]` |
| [0035](0035-match-destructures-fields-as-binds-the-whole.md) | A match case destructures a case's fields; `as` binds the whole; Option binds positionally (`\| Some v`) | `[#match]`, `[#algebraic-types]` |
| [0036](0036-tuples-and-exposing-parentheses.md) | Tuples `(a, b)` are expression-level first-class values; a module's `exposing`/`import` lists use parentheses | `[#tuple]`, `[#modules]`, `[#delimiters]` |
| [0037](0037-tuple-types-in-signatures.md) | Tuple types are writable in helper/stdlib signatures, not at a codec boundary | `[#tuple]`, `[#stdlib-map]` |
| [0038](0038-user-recursion-over-self-referential-data.md) | User helpers may recurse over self-referential data; a recursive helper is lowered to a method | `[#fn-declaration]`, `[#algebraic-types]` |
| [0039](0039-set-collection-type.md) | Set is a collection type; its external representation is a deduplicated array | `[#collections]`, `[#stdlib-set]` |
| [0040](0040-typed-map-keys.md) | A Map key may be a String-backed newtype, not only String | `[#collections]`, `[#stdlib-map]` |
| [0041](0041-map-higher-order-operations.md) | Map's fold/map/update self-host over List.fold; update is a value step, not an Option step | `[#stdlib-map]` |
| [0042](0042-defer-rrb-and-transient-fold-accumulation.md) | Defer RRB concatenation and a transient fold accumulator; the persistent-collection performance backlog is closed | — |
| [0043](0043-optional-module-header-for-single-file.md) | A single-file compilation unit may omit the `module` header (named after the file, or `Main`); an imported/multi-file module must declare it | `[#modules]` |
| [0044](0044-diagnostics-as-data-with-renderer-layer.md) | Diagnostics are data rendered Elm-style or as JSON by a locale-aware layer (Japanese default); the code and source region are the stable identity | `[#compile-errors]`, `[#non-functional]` |
| [0045](0045-string-append-and-concat-elm-aligned.md) | `++` is Elm's appendable (two lists or two strings); `String.append(a, b)` joins two strings and `String.concat(xs)` flattens a `List<String>` | `[#stdlib-string]`, `[#stdlib-list]` |
| [0046](0046-example-compile-time-checked-in-language-tests.md) | `example` rows attached to a behavior are checked at compile time (a mismatch is `E1905`); inline or in an attached `examples for` file; the pure/total model is what lets the compiler evaluate them | `[#examples]`, `[#compile-errors]` |
| [0047](0047-newtype-compared-by-its-wrapped-value.md) | A single-value newtype is compared by its wrapped value (no `.value`): same newtype or a bare literal, never a different newtype or a non-literal; ordering needs an ordered base; arithmetic deferred | `[#newtype-comparison]`, `[#newtype]` |
| [0048](0048-fake-test-doubles-for-injected-dependencies.md) | An example fakes a behavior's `requires`: `with dep = value` (value dependency) or a `fake dep \| table` (function dependency, value-equality lookup); a `Behavior` proxy at evaluation, no class shipped; local-only | `[#example-fakes]`, `[#compile-errors]` |
| [0049](0049-behavior-interface-hides-result-union.md) | A fn/`>->` behavior is a public interface (`$Impl` holds the body, `of()`/`bind()` build it) so Java declares it by name and never spells the result union; the union suffix is `Result`; an injected behavior stays an abstract class | `[#jvm-behavior]`, `[#jvm-anonymous-union]` |
| [0050](0050-infer-non-recursive-helper-value-parameters.md) | A non-recursive helper's value parameter types are inferred from its call sites; a function parameter and a recursive helper still declare theirs | `[#fn-declaration]` |
| [0051](0051-fold-is-a-recursive-helper.md) | `fold` is a recursive helper (`foldFrom`) over `List.get`, not a privileged loop: its step is a first-class closure, its tail self-call is compiled to a loop, and a recursive helper may take a pure function parameter | `[#stdlib]`, `[#blocks]`, `[#fn-declaration]` |
| [0052](0052-recursion-total-by-default.md) | Recursion is total by default, checked by size-change termination over the structural sub-term order (covers self, mutual, and lexicographic recursion); `partial` opts out (a `partial` member opts its whole mutual group out); numeric/index recursion must be `partial` (no inductive `Nat`); stdlib `foldFrom` is trusted total; example evaluation is time-bounded | `[#fn-declaration]`, `[#examples]` |
| [0053](0053-stdlib-implementation-location-policy.md) | Every stdlib function is declared in a core module (self-hosted or `intrinsic` kernel), not a hardcoded compiler table; the compiler-integrated set is closed to operators, ordered-constrained generics, and primitive-headed-union returns; `Int`/`Decimal` `add`/`subtract`/`multiply`/`compare` move to `souther.int`/`souther.decimal`, and `Int.modBy` (Elm floored modulo) is added | `[#intrinsics]`, `[#stdlib-int]`, `[#stdlib-decimal]` |
| [0054](0054-newtype-constructor-destructuring-pattern.md) | A newtype case is opened in `match` with the constructor form `X(v)`, nestable as `X(Y(s))` to reach through a newtype-over-newtype in one pattern (F#/Elm parity, name-checked per layer); `.value` stays as the single-layer accessor (Kotlin value-class positioning); pure sugar lowered to the existing `LetIn`+`FieldAccess` chain, no new Core node | `[#match]`, `[#newtype]` |
| [0055](0055-bare-field-getter.md) | A bare `.field` is sugar for the getter `(x) -> x.field` (Elm notation, Scala `_.field` meaning), lowered at parse time to a second-class block; single-layer, works for any field, not a first-class value | `[#blocks]`, `[#pipe]` |
| [0056](0056-injected-behaviors-are-multi-argument.md) | Injected behaviors may take several inputs (injection is orthogonal to composition): 0/1-input stays the unary `Behavior<I,O>` `>->` stage, 2+ inputs is a standalone base with a typed `apply(A,B,…)` called via `invokevirtual`; collection params keep their `java.util` type, not `Object` | `[#java-base-class]`, `[#jvm-behavior]`, `[#example-fakes]` |
