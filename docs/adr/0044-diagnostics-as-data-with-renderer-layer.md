# ADR-0044: Diagnostics are data rendered by a locale-aware layer

Status: Accepted

## Context

Souther grounds its syntax in Elm, and Elm's error messages are a large part of why people reach for
it: a titled report, the offending source line quoted with a caret under the problem, the two types
that disagree shown side by side, and a hint on how to fix it. Souther's compile errors did not come
close. A single `CompileException` carried a `SourcePos` and an optional code, and its message was
built by string concatenation at the throw site and frozen into the exception at construction. The
CLI printed `e.getMessage()` verbatim — one line of `line:col CODE: message`, no source snippet, no
caret, no color. About 180 throw sites each spelled their message inline in English; only ~15 codes
were wired. There was no message catalog and no locale: the text was English, always.

Three things were wanted, and they turned out to share one prerequisite.

- Elm-quality human output — a snippet, a caret, found-vs-expected type blocks, hints.
- Machine-readable output for tools and agents — a stable code and source region a program can act
  on without parsing prose. (JSON is not "more readable" to a model; its value is a stable identity
  and coordinates that do not move when the prose or the locale changes.)
- Japanese and English messages. The author, the book (smdd-book), and the expected audience are
  Japanese; English is the second locale.

The shared prerequisite is to stop freezing a formatted string and instead carry the diagnostic as
data, then render it. Once a diagnostic is data, i18n is choosing a message template by locale, the
Elm view is one renderer, and JSON is another.

## Decision

Model a diagnostic as a value (`souther.compiler.diag.Diagnostic`): a severity, an optional
code, a primary `Region`, optional secondary `Region`s each with a label, a message (a catalog key
plus arguments, or a compatibility literal), an optional found-vs-expected type pair, hints, and a
suggestion. A `DiagnosticRenderer` turns it into text — `HumanRenderer` (Elm-style, with color when
stderr is a TTY) or `JsonRenderer`. Prose comes from a `ResourceBundle` catalog: `messages_ja`
(default) over an English base (`messages.properties`); a key missing from Japanese falls back to
English, a key missing from both renders as itself, so the compiler never crashes on an unmigrated
site. Locale is resolved once: `--lang` > `SOUTHER_LANG` > the JVM default > Japanese. The code and
the type strings are locale-independent — the stable identity; titles, messages, hints, and labels
follow the locale.

`CompileException` now wraps a `Diagnostic`. Its `getMessage()` still returns the old one-line form,
so existing callers and tests are unchanged, while a renderer can take `diagnostic()` and produce the
snippet or JSON. An unmigrated throw site is wrapped as a `literal` diagnostic and renders through the
same pipeline immediately — a snippet and a localized frame, with the message body still the old
English string. The CLI (`compile` and `run`) gained `--format human|json`, `--lang`, and `--color`.

Two decisions bound the scope.

- Underlines are token-width, not full expression spans. `SourcePos` stays a point; a region is the
  point plus the offending token's length, computed at the throw site. The `Diagnostic` model is
  nevertheless region-capable (a `Region` is start-plus-end, and secondary regions are first-class),
  so an error that needs to point at more than one place — the two branches of a disagreeing `if`,
  the two sides of a failed composition — does so today, and precise multi-line spans can be added
  later without repainting the throw sites. Threading an end position through every AST node and
  every desugar pass was not worth its cost for a token-width default.
- The high-value errors are rewritten, the rest are migrated as-is. A handful of errors carry most
  of the felt quality — a type mismatch (found vs expected), an `if` whose branches disagree (each
  branch pointed at with its type), a non-exhaustive match (every missing case listed). These are
  written Elm-style with a `Type.show` that reads like source (`List<Int>`, `A | B`, `Int?`) rather
  than the record `toString`. The remaining ~148 messages move onto catalog keys mechanically, with
  the English literal as the fallback until each is translated.

## Consequences

- Every compile error renders Elm-style — titled, with a quoted line and caret — and in the selected
  locale, including sites not yet migrated onto a catalog key.
- `getMessage()` keeps its old text, so the ~30 tests that assert on message substrings stay green;
  the richer content lives on `diagnostic()`. The renderer's improved prose and the legacy one-liner
  can diverge until a site's tests are moved onto the structured diagnostic.
- A `code` and a `region` are available as JSON for an editor, CI, or agent; prose can be localized
  without breaking anything that keys on the code.
- Full Japanese coverage of all ~180 messages is a follow-through, not a single change: the mechanism
  and the high-value messages ship bilingual, and each remaining message becomes Japanese as it is
  migrated, falling back to English until then.
- A multi-file build has no per-diagnostic file identity (SourcePos carries no file), so a snippet is
  quoted only for a single-file compile; a linked build renders the frame and message without the
  source line until a file handle is added to the position.

## Amendment: the file handle is on the position (issue #309)

The last consequence deferred a file handle on the position, and a compile worked out which file a
report belonged to from the question that found it instead. That holds while each question is about
one file and stops holding where it is not: a module's `example` rows, fake tables and values are
written in the module's own source and in any number of attached `examples for` files, and once they
are gathered under one name a question asked about the module can only answer with the module's own
file. What the author was then shown was the right line number quoted out of the wrong file — an
unrelated declaration with a caret in the middle of it.

So `SourcePos` now carries the source it was read from. It is given once, where a position is made
from a text (`LineIndex`), so no later pass has to reconstruct it, and it reaches every position a
parse makes without an AST walker. A position read from no source of this compile — a synthesized
node, the standard library, a module read back off the module path — names none, and a reader falls
back as it did before.

The source is part of what makes two positions the same position. Line 25 of two files is one
coordinate and is not one place, and a value whose identity denied one of its components would leave
"the same position" meaning something different in every container that held one — which is the
original mistake, re-expressible. Where coordinates alone are wanted, they are compared as
coordinates.
