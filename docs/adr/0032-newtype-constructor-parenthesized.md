# ADR-0032: A newtype is constructed by applying its name, parenthesized: `Amount(500)`

Status: Accepted (decided 2026-07-18; implemented)

## Context

A newtype `data Amount = Int` is nominally distinct from `Int` (ADR-0014). Until now its values
arose only at the decode boundary; there was no in-language way to build one from a literal
or a computed value.

ML-family languages construct a wrapper by applying the constructor: Haskell and Elm write
`Money 500`, F# `Money 500` or `Money(500)`. The juxtaposition form is unambiguous in
Haskell and Elm because constructors are Capitalized — the parser tells `Money 500`
(construction) from `money - 5` (subtraction) lexically. Souther's identifiers are Unicode
(Japanese domain terms) with no case distinction, so `Amount 500` cannot be told from
`Amount - 5` at parse time. And Souther already applies functions with parentheses everywhere
(`f(x)`, `length(value)`) — the F#-tupled branch of ML, not Haskell/Elm currying.

## Decision

Construct a newtype by applying its type name to one argument, parenthesized: `Amount(500)`,
`MemberId("m-01")`. It is the record literal `Amount { value = e }` written in call form — the
type name in call position is the constructor. This matches Souther's parenthesized
application and avoids the `Amount -5` ambiguity a juxtaposition form would carry.

An invariant violation *aborts*, as for any data construction (ADR-0029,
`[#violation-destination]`); construction is not fallible in the domain (there is no
`Amount | Invalid`). So no constant-only restriction is needed: a runtime argument is allowed and
aborts on violation, exactly like an invariant-bearing product `Discounted { amount = x }`.

When the argument is a compile-time constant and the invariant folds to `true`, the
construction cannot abort: it is checked at compile time — so `Amount(-5)` is a compile error,
not a runtime abort — and may sit anywhere, including a non-tail `let money = Amount(500)`. A
runtime argument to an invariant-bearing newtype may likewise sit wherever an expression may —
the behavior's result, a non-tail `let`, a `match` arm — and aborts on violation, like any
invariant-bearing construction.

## Consequences

The parser is unchanged: `Amount(500)` already parses as a call. The checker routes a call
whose name is a newtype to construction and, when the argument folds to a constant, records
it. The constant argument is verified by **compile-time function evaluation**: the backend
emits, per invariant-bearing newtype, a Raoh-free `$Ctfe.check(value)` that runs the *same*
invariant bytecode `__construct` runs, and after codegen the compiler loads it and runs each
recorded constant. A violation is a compile error, with no second evaluator that could
disagree with run time. The backend emits a plain construction when the newtype has no
invariant, and the checked `__construct` (which aborts on violation) for a runtime argument,
whether it sits in tail or value position.

CTFE couples the compiler to `souther-runtime` (a `provided` dependency): it loads generated
code, and a lambda-bearing invariant's bytecode references the runtime `Fn`. When the class
cannot be loaded or run at compile time, CTFE degrades to the run-time check. The compiler
still does not depend on Raoh — CTFE runs the bare boolean invariant, not the
Raoh-returning decoder or `__construct`.

That degradation is not a refusal, and ADR-0115 is the decision it sits next to. What Souther
accepts is bounded by what the JVM can *emit*: a declaration no JVM would load is refused to the
author at the declaration (E2101, E2102, E2103). What the JVM can *run* on the day of the compile
bounds nothing. A `$Ctfe.check` that will not load leaves the construction in
`ConstantOutcome.NotEvaluatedHere` — one of three answers to running one check, and the one that
says the invariant is checked when the program runs. A compile that stopped there would be reading
this ADR backwards.

Two alternatives were rejected. A capitalization convention marking constructors (which
would enable `Amount 500`) is incompatible with free Japanese naming. Type-ascription
construction (`let money: Amount = 500`) opens a nominal hole, letting a bare `Int` become a
`Amount` by annotation.
