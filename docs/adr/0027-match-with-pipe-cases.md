# ADR-0027: match reads `match e with | case -> ...`

Status: Accepted (decided 2026-07-18; implemented)

## Context

match is written as a braced block with a `case` keyword before each case:

```text
match submitTravelRequest(request) {
    case Submitted as s   -> ...
    case AwaitingPreApproval as p -> ...
}
```

That shape is the C-family `switch { case }`, and it is neither of the ML forms Souther
grounds in. F# writes `match e with | P -> ...`; Elm writes `case e of` followed by
layout-indented cases.

## Decision

Adopt the F# form. `|` separates the cases, and there are no braces and no `case` keyword.

```text
match submitTravelRequest(request) with
| Submitted as s   -> ...
| AwaitingPreApproval as p -> ...
```

`|` is already the case separator of a sum type (`data X = A | B`); F# uses the same symbol
inside `match`, and Souther follows. An or-pattern is `| A | B -> ...`.

Elm's `case ... of` was not taken because it delimits cases by layout, and Souther is not
layout-sensitive. F#'s `|` delimits cases without layout, so it is the ML form that fits a
grammar built on braces and tokens.

## Consequences

match loses the braces that made it look like Souther's other blocks, but it gains the ML
reading and drops the redundant `case` keyword. After `with`, a `|` is unambiguous: a match
case is a pattern, not an expression, so it cannot be confused with the sum-type `|` in a
type position or the `||` operator in a term.

The case still binds by `as` and dispatches on a named data reference (ADR-0013); an
or-pattern still binds a variable at the scrutinee's sum type. Only the surrounding
syntax — `with` and `|` in place of braces and `case` — changes.
