# ADR-0018: No dedicated update syntax; use a named record literal with spread

Status: Accepted. The spread is spelled `...` (three dots), not `..`, since ADR-0030 unified
the spread spelling across type and value level.

## Context

Many languages provide a functional-update form (`{ x with address = newAddress }`) to replace some fields of an immutable record. Souther considered such a form (an earlier `with`) and dropped it.

## Decision

To replace some fields of a value of the same type, write the type name plus spread: `Member { ..x, address = newAddress }`. There is no dedicated update syntax.

## Consequences

In Souther, business-meaningful change crosses a type boundary (`request → PreApproved`), so same-type rewrites are rare. Adding a "no type name" construction form for that rare case would break the rule that every construction names its type — the rule that lets construction-permission and field checks happen at the construction point (ADR-0002). Keeping the type name on every literal, including updates, keeps that rule intact and keeps one construction form to reason about.
