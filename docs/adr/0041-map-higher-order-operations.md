# ADR-0041: Map's higher-order operations fold over the entries; update is a value step, not an Option step

Status: Accepted

## Context

`Map` had accessors (`get`, `containsKey`, `keys`, `values`), building operations (`empty`,
`singleton`, `insert`, `remove`, `isEmpty`, `size`), and the entry-list conversions (`toList`,
`fromList`), but nothing that takes a step function. A domain that keeps state in a
`Map<商品ID, 在庫>` could not aggregate over it (sum the stock), transform its values, or update one
key's value without leaving the language for a Java binding. Elm's `Dict` and F#'s `Map` both carry
`fold`, `map`, and `update`, and the specification already named these three as the missing piece.

Two of Souther's own rules shape how they can be added. The standard library iterates through one
recursive helper, `List.fold` (ADR-0028, ADR-0051); a separate map recursion would be a second thing
to walk and keep correct. And `Option` is not a surface-writable type (ADR-0011): a value cannot be
written as `Some v`, `None` is not a value expression, and a bare value does not wrap into an
`Option` position in the language. So a step function cannot return an `Option`.

## Decision

Add `fold`, `map`, and `update` to `souther.map`, all self-hosted — no new intrinsic, no map loop.

- **`fold(step, seed, m)` folds `List.fold` over the entries.** `Map.fold` is
  `List.fold(step', seed, Map.toList(m))`: it reuses the list fold rather than walking the map itself,
  and the entries combine in the map's deterministic hash order (`toList`'s order, [#stdlib-map]), so a fold
  that combines its values reproduces the same result each run. The step is `(acc, key, value)`, the
  key and value passed separately — F#'s `Map.fold` folder is `state key value`, Elm's `Dict.foldl`
  is `k v acc`. The entry tuple `toList` yields is destructured inside the fold and handed on.
- **`map(f, m)` keeps the keys and rewrites the values**, `f` being `(key, value) -> value` (Elm's
  `Dict.map`, F#'s `Map.map`). It grows a fresh map through `Map.fold`, inserting `f(key, value)`
  under each key.
- **`update(key, f, m)` rewrites one present key's value with `f: ('a) -> 'a`; an absent key is a
  no-op.** This is *not* Elm's `Dict.update : comparable -> (Maybe v -> Maybe v) -> Dict -> Dict`.
  Elm's step both reads and returns a `Maybe`, so it can insert a new key (`Nothing -> Just v`) and
  remove one (`Just v -> Nothing`) in the same call. In Souther that step is unwritable: `Option` is
  not a surface type (ADR-0011), so `f` can neither take nor return one. `update` therefore covers
  only the "change what is already there" case; a new key is added with `insert` and a key is dropped
  with `remove`. (A later addition, `upsert(key, default, f, m)`, combines insert-if-absent with
  modify in one call while staying `Option`-free — the absent branch takes a plain value, `default`,
  not a `Maybe` — spec §stdlib-map.)

## Consequences

The three per-key patterns a stateful map needs — aggregate, transform, modify — are now in the
language, and the review's `Map<商品ID, 在庫>` (issue stock, tally, update one key) no longer falls
through to a Java binding. `fold` being `List.fold` over `toList` means every property already true
of list folding — the inlined step, the empty-map bottom, the deterministic order — holds for maps
for free; `map` and `update` inherit it in turn.

`update`'s narrower shape is a visible consequence of ADR-0011, not an oversight. Modeling "insert or
remove depending on what is there" through a single `Maybe -> Maybe` step is an Elm idiom that leans
on `Maybe` being an ordinary constructible value. Souther deliberately keeps absence in the domain as
a named sum (`-> 会員 | 会員なし`) rather than an `Option` users pass around, so the idiom has no home
here; `insert` / `remove` / `update` split the three cases that Elm's one function merges. If a later
change ever makes `Option` surface-writable, `update` could widen to the Elm shape without breaking
the value-step form (a value step is the `Just v -> Just (f v)` case of it).
