 * A first-class function value — a lambda that has escaped its lexical scope and so cannot be

 * with the captured free variables held in final fields and the body compiled into {@link #apply}.
 *
 * <p>Souther functions are multi-argument (not curried), so {@code apply} takes the arguments as an
 * array; a call site of known arity boxes its arguments into it. A function that does not escape is
 * still expanded inline and never becomes an {@code Fn}.
