/**
 * A domain invariant broken inside the domain — the abort of spec 7.3 / 9.4 / 19.7. When a
 * behavior constructs invariant-bearing data whose invariant fails, the computation aborts by
 * throwing this instead of returning a business case: an invariant violation is a model bug, not
 * a business result, so it has no place in the output sum (spec 2.6).
 *
 * <p>Souther code cannot catch it (there is no catch syntax), so it never drives business flow
 * (spec 3). A boundary (e.g. HTTP) may catch it and map it to a 500 — distinct from a business
 * failure, which arrives as an output case and maps to a 400 (spec 19.7). Decode-side violations
 * are different: they are carried by Raoh's {@code Result} failure, not by this (spec 10.5).
