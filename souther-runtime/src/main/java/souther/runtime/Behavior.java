 * A behavior: a single-input transformation from {@code I} to one of its output cases

 * sum), never a Result wrapper. Whether a case leaves the Railway main line is decided at
 * composition by {@code >->} (spec §composition): the generated pipeline routes each value to
 * the next stage when that stage's input type accepts it, and carries it through unchanged
 * otherwise. Composition is emitted as bytecode by the backend, so this interface only
 * needs {@code apply}.
