/**
 * A value the usage offers is a value the command takes.
 *
 * <p>The table holds what an option is called and what it takes so that the usage text and the
 * parsers cannot come apart. That holds while one option is one command's. Where two commands share
 * a spelling and read it differently, the value spelling has to be the reading's as well — and it
 * was not: `--adequacy` was widened to `examples` with the table's own words left as `compile`'s, so
 * the usage offered `off`, `witness` and `all` under a command whose whole output is the report and
 * which refuses all three.
 *
 * <p>Asked by running the command with each value the usage prints, which is the only way to ask it
 * of the parser rather than of a second list beside it. What a value <em>means</em> is not asked
 * here; what is asked is that the command does not turn it down for being a word it does not know.
