/**
 * A search that composes a value and sees it take a rule shows something can stand there, and
 * covers nothing.
 *
 * <p>The two are the same object read for two things. What the search built is evidence about the
 * model — this rule is one a row can be written at — and it is in nobody's {@code example} block, so
 * the rows have not reached it. Read for the other, a search would satisfy a coverage item nobody
 * wrote a row for, and the account would report a model as answered by rows that do not exist.
 *
 * <p>The rule under test is the one a conjunction masks: rows through both arms of {@code A && B}
 * leave the way where {@code A} held and {@code B} failed untried, and something plainly stands
 * there.
