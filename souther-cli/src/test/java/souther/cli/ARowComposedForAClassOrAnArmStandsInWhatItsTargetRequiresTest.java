/**
 * A candidate composed for a class of a position or for an arm of the body stands its target's
 * dependencies in, so it is a candidate something can run.
 *
 * <p>Which is what settles what it fills. What a class or an arm asks about is the positions, and
 * nothing on that route asks a dependency for one answer over another — but the behavior cannot be
 * applied without one, so a candidate composed without them is one nothing runs, and what it
 * reaches is then read off the body instead of watched. The arm it was steered to stays unanswered
 * and the row goes out saying less than it did.
 *
 * <p>Both halves are asserted because each fails on its own: that the candidate runs, and that the
 * row it becomes says what it stood the dependency in with. A row certified by a run in one
 * environment and offered in another is the two coming apart.
