/**
 * An option the run does not read is not passed over in silence.
 *
 * <p>Not that every option written is read — {@code api Option --source String} answers about
 * {@code Option} and drops the option, and says which of the two it read rather than refusing the
 * line. What holds of all of them is the weaker sentence: an option a line writes is one that
 * invocation has a reader for, or the line is refused.
 *
 * <p>Has a reader for, and not that the output changed. {@code compile ok.sou --color always} writes
 * what it writes without the option — nothing went wrong, so there was no diagnostic to colour — and
 * the colour policy was read all the same. {@code --format human} names the default and is read
 * too. Reading a difference in the output as the sign that an option applied would call both of
 * those the defect this class is about, and would call every option whose effect depends on the
 * source one whenever the source does not exercise it. What is asked here is whether the invocation
 * has anywhere to read the option, which is a question about the line and is settled from the line.
 *
 * <p>{@code --boundaries} on its own was accepted and answered with the report it would have printed
 * anyway. The flag is read at one place, inside the branch {@code --generate} opens, so a line that
 * wrote it without {@code --generate} set a variable nothing looked at — and a reader who had just
 * been told {@code boundary 0/2} read the unchanged report as an answer about their model rather
 * than as an option that never applied. Silence is the one thing the command line cannot say here,
 * and the same command already holds the opposite standard for {@code --module} and
 * {@code --behavior}: a name that resolves to no subject is a usage error, not a report of nothing.
 *
 * <p>Every command, and not only the ones whose parser thought to ask. {@code doc} and {@code api}
 * read their options by position and had no case for a token they did not expect, so
 * {@code api Option --nope} ran as though it were not there and {@code api --search fold --limit 1}
 * printed every hit.
