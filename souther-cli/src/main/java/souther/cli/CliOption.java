/**
 * The options this command line takes, and what has to hold of a line that writes them.
 *
 * <p>Each command used to answer this for itself, out of the tokens it had a {@code case} for and a
 * default branch that read everything else as a path. That answers one question — is this token
 * mine — and only in the commands that thought to ask it: {@code doc} and {@code api} never did, so
 * {@code api Option --nope} ran as though nothing had been written. It also cannot answer the other
 * question at all. An option arrives as a local variable, and a local carries its value and not the
 * fact that somebody wrote it, so an option whose reader sits behind a condition that did not hold
 * is indistinguishable from one nobody asked for. {@code --boundaries} without {@code --generate}
 * was accepted, never read, and answered with the report it would have printed anyway.
 *
 * <p>So what a line wrote is kept as what it wrote — the set of options present, before any of them
 * is turned into a value — and the constraints are read off this table once, above the dispatch,
 * for every command. Three of them are structural and are written here: which command an option
 * belongs to, which other option it needs beside it, and which two may not be written together. The
 * fourth kind is not: whether an option's value makes the next one pointless (a colour under a JSON
 * renderer) is a question about what the values mean, which belongs to the command that means them.
