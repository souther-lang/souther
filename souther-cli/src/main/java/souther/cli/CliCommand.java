/**
 * The commands this command line has, and what each one is for.
 *
 * <p>The one place a command name is resolved. The dispatch used to name them in a {@code switch}
 * over strings and the usage text named them again in prose, so a command was two statements that
 * agreed by hand: the text said {@code mcp} was an option of {@code api} for as long as nobody
 * read it against anything. A name resolves to a constant here and the dispatch switches over the
 * constants, so a command added to this table and left undispatched is a build that does not
 * compile rather than a drift a test has to go looking for.
 *
 * <p>{@code help} is one of them and not a shape the dispatch knows about. It is a command an author
 * writes like any other, so it has what the others have — arguments it takes, a line saying what it
 * is for, and a section of its own that {@code souther help help} answers with. A meta-command
 * special-cased above the table would be the one command unable to explain itself.
 *
 * <p>What a command takes is not written here. {@link CliOption} says which commands each option
 * belongs to, and a section is built by asking it; the only thing this table says about an option
 * is what it means <em>under this command</em>, where that differs from what the option means on
 * its own.
