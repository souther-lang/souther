  "The HTTP boundary. It decodes the JSON request body into WithdrawRequest (re-checking invariants
   -- a negative amount is rejected here), runs withdraw inside one transaction, and folds its
   sealed output into an HTTP status with `souther.match/case-of` (which checks at compile time that
   every case is handled, carrying Souther's match totality across the boundary). The controller
   never constructs domain data itself: input goes through the generated decoder, output through the
   case fold. A platform failure (a SQL exception) is not a domain case: Souther passes it through
   untouched and it propagates to the framework (ordering shows the full 503 + rollback treatment)."
