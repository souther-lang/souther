/**
 * Who may say that a rule is answerable for a position, and where the place an author wrote is
 * settled.
 *
 * <p>What a rule was short of is made where the asking is: the reading that could not take a form
 * in knows the position, the reason and the clause it was reading, and everything downstream is
 * handed the answer. A pass reaching for the constructor makes the fact out of whatever it has —
 * a place's reasons, most easily, which name every rule that reached the place and not the one
 * that asked.
 *
 * <p>The site is held apart from that. A conjunction distributing over a choice copies a shortfall
 * into both branches, and what says the two copies are one fact is that they carry one site. Minted
 * again on the way, a copy would be a second fact of the same shape — and a choice asking whether
 * the branch that went unread accounts for a position would read a shortfall standing in both
 * branches as that branch's own.
 *
 * <p>Read off the compiled classes, so a maker reached through a method reference is one of these:
 * a constructor handed to something that will call it makes a fact as surely as calling it here.
