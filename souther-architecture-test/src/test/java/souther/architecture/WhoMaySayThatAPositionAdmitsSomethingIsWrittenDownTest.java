/**
 * Who may say that a position admits something, and who may only say that one admits nothing.
 *
 * <p>{@link Emptiness} answers three ways and the two settled answers are not one another's mirror.
 * Either half of a pair holding nothing leaves the pair nothing, so {@code EMPTY} is sound from
 * whichever reading reached it. {@code NONEMPTY} is a claim about the whole of what was asked, and
 * {@code Confinement} says in its own words what that whole is: which values a position may take
 * and where its order stops, and nothing else. The components beside it stay outside, so a reader
 * taking one of these answers for "a value of this declaration exists" would be holding a claim no
 * reduction here carries.
 *
 * <p>So everywhere the word is said is written down. What the lists hold is readings that work an
 * admission out and hand it on; what they must not grow is a reader that acts on the settled
 * positive answer as though it were about more than the reading that gave it.
 *
 * <p><b>Three rules and not one, because they are three claims.</b> The widest names every nest
 * that touches a settled answer at all — said as a constant, or asked of one through the operations
 * that observe and compose settledness, since {@code a.joined(b)} carries a positive answer onwards
 * without spelling one. Inside it is who may decide the positive answer. Inside that is the one the
 * contract is about: which nests outside the readings themselves say it.
 *
 * <p><b>What these rules do not say.</b> They fix who may name a settled answer, and not who may
 * act on one: a nest already on a list can grow a second reader of an answer it was already making,
 * and no owner set changes. What is claimed is what a walk over the compiled classes holds.
 *
 * <p><b>And beside them, which reading of the word each place is.</b> A nest is who may hold a
 * claim; a reading is one method, so those rules name the class, the method and what it takes and
 * gives — a permission written as a name would widen to an overload added later, and what they are
 * written down as is the questions this compiler has not decided. The word's own class is passed
 * over by the rules about who says it, and by them only: the meanings are worked out there, so a
 * reading there that no meaning answered is one nobody decided in the one place that decides them.
 *
 * <p>What those rules are about is a reference compared against one of the constants, which is what
 * a repository whose enums are compared with {@code ==} writes. A comparison spelt some other way
 * is not one of them, and what they hold is that spelling and not every way two of these could be
 * told apart.
 *
 * <p>Read off those classes, because a call is what the compiler made of it: a lambda body, a
 * method reference and a switch are three spellings a scan of source text would have to know about
 * one at a time. Every module's classes, because this module is built last and a check living in
 * the module it is about passes over everything built after it.
 *
 * <p><b>Every list here is what a walk found, so every walk is held to a body beside this test.</b>
 * A list and the walk that fills it are written together and agree by construction: what a walk
 * stopped reading drops out of the list, and the list is then what the walk can still see rather
 * than what the repository holds. So each of them is shown finding something written here —
 * {@link Taking} and {@link TakingByStanding} switch, {@link Referring} asks through a reference,
 * {@link Comparing} compares every way one can be written, a name away and a conditional away
 * included — and, where something near it would look the same to a walk that read less, shown not
 * finding that: {@link Constructing} writes a constant where a value is wanted, and calls one
 * before comparing what the call gave.
