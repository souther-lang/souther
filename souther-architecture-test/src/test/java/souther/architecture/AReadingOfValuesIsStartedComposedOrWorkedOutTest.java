/**
 * Every way a reading of worked-out values is made, and what each of them was handed to make it.
 *
 * <p>A rule of the model enters as a description ({@code PlannedValues}), and a description is
 * turned into values once, under an allowance, by {@code resolve}. That is where the rules of one
 * value's positions become sets — so a reading of values is either the empty one a reading starts
 * from, or one composed of readings already worked out, or one worked out from a description. What
 * there is no way to make is a leaf: a reading of values standing for a rule, made straight out of
 * a position, a set of values, or a reason a rule went unread, without a description having been
 * worked out.
 *
 * <p>A second vocabulary for that would be a second answer to what a rule of the values comes to,
 * and the two would not be the same answer. What {@code resolve} settles is what the allowance let
 * it build and what it went short of, and a reading minted beside it is one where those questions
 * were never asked — so a caller reads it as a reading whose every position was worked out. That is
 * the shape a compiler can never make and a test can, which is how tests came to be written against
 * readings the fold does not build.
 *
 * <p><b>What this does not say.</b> Composing two readings already worked out is not narrowed here
 * — a conjunction of them is what a declaration's clauses come to, and it is on this side of
 * working one out by design. The representation is not this rule's either: that a reading is not
 * written down from its parts is held by the type, whose parts are its own and whose one
 * constructor takes them as one thing ({@code AdmissibleValues}). What the two say together is why
 * neither leaves a gap — a maker handed the parts would be found here whatever it was called, and a
 * maker handed a position or a set of values is what this refuses.
 *
 * <p>Read off the compiled classes, since a construction reached through a method reference makes a
 * reading as surely as one written out, and neither the enclosing declaration nor a switch over a
 * sealed type is visible to a scan of source text. Every module's, because a maker anywhere in the
 * repository is one of these.
