/**
 * A reading builds a refusal by looking for both of its witnesses, and never by naming one.
 *
 * <p>An alternative is a conjunction of its sides, so one refused at a block and refused about
 * blocks together is refused both ways. A maker that takes one half is a maker whose caller has
 * already decided which witness to look for, and the thing it had to decide with is the other half
 * — so the refusal it builds names whichever of the two its author asked about first, and the
 * other is gone with nothing saying it was there. The entry that looks for both takes the two
 * questions instead of their answers, and neither of them can be put to the other.
 *
 * <p><b>Which is a rule about the readings and not about the makers.</b> Something that genuinely
 * proves one half proves one half: a walk over the ranges that refuses positions has no relation in
 * hand to read, and a refusal about the blocks it names is the whole of what it showed. Those
 * makers stay, and what is closed is that no reading builds an alternative's refusal out of one of
 * them.
 *
 * <p>Read off the compiled calls, since what a reading may not do is call it. A rule kept as a
 * habit is one the next producer is written without, and there have been four of them.
