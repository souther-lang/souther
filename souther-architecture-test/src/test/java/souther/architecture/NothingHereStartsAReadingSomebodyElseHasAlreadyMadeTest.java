/**
 * Every place this compiler starts a reading of a declaration that somebody else has already made
 * is written down here.
 *
 * <p>Reading a declaration is what a question about its rules costs, and the readings a question
 * needs beyond the first are readings of the same declaration again: attributing an end reads it
 * once per conjunct that could be holding one. So a reading is lent — made once for a declaration
 * under a revision and handed to whoever asks next — and where the lending is reached, a reader
 * says where it borrows from ({@code DeclarationReadings}).
 *
 * <p><b>A reader that says nothing gets nothing, and nothing about that fails.</b> The entry points
 * come in pairs: one takes the lending and one does not, and the second reads for itself and
 * answers the same. A caller that reached for the shorter one loses every reading the lending had
 * to give and is told by nothing at all — which is how a boundary search came to build a
 * declaration's string machines again for each value it probed.
 *
 * <p><b>What is written down is the edge and not the place it arrives at.</b> A reader that starts
 * such a reading is reached by a call, and a table of readers says nothing about who is calling
 * them: a way in named here as allowed would let a new caller of it arrive with nothing to fail.
 * So each row is one production instruction reaching one place, both ends said in full, and the
 * whole set is compared — a row that has gone is as much a finding as one that has appeared.
 *
 * <p><b>Two claims and not one.</b> That this compiler can express an evaluation with no store
 * behind it, which is one way in and is named; and that nothing here spends one, which is no
 * readers at all. Read as a single population the second would be satisfied by the first going
 * missing, and a walk that had stopped reading call sites would report a compiler that starts no
 * such reading. So the way in is asserted to be there, and the readers to be none.
 *
 * <p>The shorter entry points stay for the same reason the way in does: a test standing one
 * declaration up to look at it is a reader with no store, and saying so is not a defect. What may
 * not happen is this compiler reaching for one.
 *
 * <p>Read off the compiled classes, because what is being asked is which method a call site
 * resolved to. The overloads differ by one argument and the shorter is reached by leaving it out,
 * which is a fact about resolution rather than about the text: a walk over spellings would be
 * deciding overload resolution again, and getting it wrong quietly.
 *
 * <p><b>Every way an instruction names a method.</b> A call is one; handing the method over to be
 * called later is another, and that arrives as a handle among the arguments a bootstrap is given.
 * A reader that passes one of these along rather than calling it starts the same reading.
