/**
 * The compiled outputs a rule here is about, and the order a name is looked for in them.
 *
 * <p>Which outputs those are is what this is: a rule here asks about a class of this repository
 * without knowing which module built it, so the question is put to several outputs in turn and the
 * first that holds the name answers it. What one output holds is read elsewhere; the population and
 * its order are here.
 *
 * <p>Not through {@code java.class.path}. What a module is handed there is the reactor's to decide
 * and it is not the same in every build — a module built beside this one arrives as its compiled
 * classes, and one already packaged arrives as a jar — so a walk over the entries is a walk over
 * something that answers differently depending on which goal was run. What a rule here is about is
 * the compiled surface of a class of this repository, and the repository is where that is.
 *
 * <p>Which output is searched is the caller's to name, because the two questions asked here are
 * about two populations. A rule about what a class of this repository offers its callers is about
 * what the repository publishes, and a class compiled beside a test is not that. A test that
 * declares its own subjects to be read is asking about those, and they are compiled where test
 * output goes. One lookup answering both would be answering each with the other's population.
 *
 * <p>A name this cannot find is not a class that reaches nothing. It is a question this cannot
 * answer, and it says so rather than answering.
 *
 * <p><b>Held for the run, because the repository does not move while it happens.</b> Where a
 * module's output is is worked out by asking the file system what a path really is, and a rule
 * following a name from one output to the next asks for the outputs once per name it follows.
