/**
 * How a caller asks for the rules that govern a declaration.
 *
 * <p>Which declarations govern one — its own and every one a spread reaches — is a walk over the
 * declarations, and it is {@code TypeOps}' walk. Two things are held of its surface, and they are
 * two because what they are about is two.
 *
 * <p><b>The walk is given a name and reads the declarations itself.</b> A caller that passed a
 * declaration node beside the world would be deciding the representation of the declaration asked
 * about while the world decided the ones under it, and nothing either of them held would say the
 * two were the same reading.
 *
 * <p><b>What a clause states is read from whatever owns that representation.</b> The settled form is
 * the derived world's, so a walk that answers with one takes {@link DerivedSymbols} and not the
 * reader that does not name a stage. The expanded form is
 * {@code ExpandedClauseLookup}'s — one question, one input, no node to fall back on — and that
 * interface holds its own answer; a rule here that demanded the derived world of it as well would
 * be reporting a walk that is already closed, by a stronger arrangement than this one.
 *
 * <p>Both are read through {@link WhatASignatureReaches}, so that what a walk is handed is read for
 * what the declaration guarantees rather than for how it was written. A world wrapped in a record,
 * named through a type variable's bound, or written as the argument of a container is the world the
 * caller has to have, and a rule that read only the types spelled beside the parameters would be
 * answered by any of those rewrites.
 *
 * <p>What this does not hold is that no walk of the kind can be written anywhere else. A class
 * reaching the declarations itself could compose its own, and no reading of a signature would say
 * so. The first line against that is which methods are reachable at all, and this is the second.
