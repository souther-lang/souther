/**
 * A construction says where it came from, and no pass says it for one.
 *
 * <p>The arms of a construction origin are declared where only {@code souther.compiler.ast} can name
 * them, so a pass elsewhere cannot make one or ask one what it means. What javac cannot refuse is a
 * pass taking an origin off a node and handing it to another node, which is the same defect a step
 * along: the answer would come from wherever the writer happened to have one rather than from what
 * the node is. So the forms are built through the constructors that take no origin, and a member
 * that takes one is this package's to call.
 *
 * <p>Read off the compiled classes and not the source, because it is a rule about who calls what: a
 * reference is in the constant pool of the class that makes it whatever the call looks like.
 *
 * <p>What is forbidden is a crossing and not a call on a particular form: from outside the package,
 * naming anything inside it that takes an origin. Written the other way — the members of the forms
 * that hold one — it would ask which forms those are, and then a method beside them taking an origin
 * and handing it on would be a way in that the question does not reach. Nothing here knows which
 * forms hold an origin, which is the compiler's own to say and is said in its tests.
 *
 * <p>What counts as an origin is read off the type: the interface and the arms it permits, so an
 * argument written as one of the arms is one of these too.
 *
 * <p>This lives in a module that depends on every other, so every module's classes are built when it
 * runs and the population is the whole repository rather than whatever happened to be built. That
 * every module is depended on is asserted below against {@link RepositoryLayout}, which is what says
 * what the repository is made of — a module added without a dependency from here would otherwise be
 * passed over in silence, and the build order does not reliably show it.
 *
 * <p>What is here is the question no module can answer alone: who, across every module of the
 * reactor, calls what.
