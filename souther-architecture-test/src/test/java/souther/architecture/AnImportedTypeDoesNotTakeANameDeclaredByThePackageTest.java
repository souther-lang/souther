/**
 * A name a package declares means that name inside the package.
 *
 * <p>Two packages may call two things by one name. A word that fits one bounded context fits
 * another, and asking every such pair to give one of them up would be a rule about the words rather
 * than about what they say — {@code Ordered} in a partition and {@code Ordered} in a query are two
 * answers to two questions, and nothing is clearer for one of them being renamed.
 *
 * <p>What is refused is one file rebinding the name. A single import wins over the package a
 * compilation unit is in, so
 *
 * <pre>
 * package a;
 * import b.X;
 * </pre>
 *
 * leaves the bare {@code X} in that file meaning {@code b.X} while the package around it declares
 * one of its own. A reader who knows where they are has to find the import before they know which
 * question they are looking at, a search for either finds both, and javac says nothing — the file
 * compiles and the two names are the same word.
 *
 * <p>The escape is to write the foreign type out where it is used. It is longer, and the length is
 * the point: such a file is holding two things one word names, and it says which it means at each
 * place it means one.
 *
 * <p><b>Whichever of the two ways the import is spelled.</b> {@code import static b.Outer.X} binds
 * {@code X} to a member type and shadows the package's own just as {@code import b.X} does, so the
 * rule is about what an import binds and not about the keyword in front of it. A static import
 * brings in the accessible static members the owner has by that name, which is not the same as the
 * members it has: a member class that is not static binds nothing, and neither does one the
 * importing source may not reach. So what is asked is what the bare name comes to mean where the
 * import is written, and the whole of the answer is the compiler's ({@link NameMeanings}). An
 * owner nothing here resolves is a third answer and is listed rather than let through
 * ({@link #everyStaticImportThatCouldTakeANameIsOneThisCanAnswerAbout}).
 *
 * <p>An on-demand import is not one of these. {@code import b.*} and {@code import static b.Outer.*}
 * are lower in precedence than the package's own members, so the bare name goes on meaning what the
 * package declares and nothing is rebound.
 *
 * <p><b>Which names a package declares is asked of the sources that compile with it.</b> A package
 * may be split across modules, and a name declared in another module's main sources is as much a
 * member of the package as one beside it. A test source is not: it is compiled apart, no main
 * source can see it, so it declares nothing a bare name in a main source could otherwise have
 * meant. So the main sources answer for every source, and a test source's own root answers for it
 * besides.
 *
 * <p>Every module's main sources, and not the ones a module is built against. Which of them a
 * compilation actually sees is its dependencies' business, and this does not read them — so a
 * package split across two modules that do not depend on each other would be answered here as one
 * package. What that costs is a name reported as taken where a compilation could not have taken
 * it, which is a thing to look at rather than one to pass over, and the packages this repository
 * splits are all along one chain of dependencies.
 *
 * <p><b>What this cannot answer, it says.</b> The question is written as a source in the package
 * and read against the classes this test runs against, which are the modules' main classes. An
 * owner that is not among them — a test class of another module, a library another module keeps to
 * itself — leaves the question unanswered, and a source in no package leaves it unasked; both are
 * listed. Neither is a rebinding and neither is the absence of one.
