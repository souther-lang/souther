/**
 * Who may read what a predicate over a string means.
 *
 * <p>A rule tells the strings it admits from the rest, and that is a fact about a language. Whether
 * the position the rule is about is divided, restricted, or left where it was found is a different
 * fact, answered by what the rule is written in — and a reader that derives the second from the
 * first is deciding a question it does not own. That is what happened: the walk that draws lines
 * read the predicate a second time, called the two sides of the language two classes of the
 * position, and published "the model divides this position into values this measure draws no line
 * between" of a declaration that refuses to build anything on the other side.
 *
 * <p>So the edge is what is checked, and not the sentence that came out of it. Renaming the reason
 * closes one occurrence; what closes the shape is that nothing between the predicate's reading and
 * a word about a position exists to be used again. The reading that turns clauses into sets is the
 * one owner, and every later reader takes what it settled.
 *
 * <p>Read off the compiled classes and not off the source, so that an intermediary put between the
 * two — a class named for anything at all, holding what the language came to — arrives here as a
 * row. A walk over spellings would find the words a reader chose and not the edge it built.
 *
 * <p><b>Every way a class reaches the table, and not only the calls.</b> Naming a member of it is
 * one way; naming the type is another, and that is what {@code instanceof}, {@code checkcast} and
 * {@code new} put in a constant pool. A classifier asking only which answer it was handed calls
 * nothing and reads the table all the same — the exact shape this exists to refuse, and the one a
 * walk over member references passes over.
 *
 * <p>And each row says what it names, so a reader is licensed for the question it asks rather than
 * for the class it happens to sit in.
 *
 * <p>Its own tests are not read. A test builds a reading to look at it and publishes nothing, and a
 * list that moved whenever one was written is a list nobody keeps up.
