/**
 * A check names what it licenses by something the source states.
 *
 * <p>A structural rule here holds a list of who may do something, each entry addressing one reader
 * by name. A lambda is compiled to a method of its own, named after the method it was written in and
 * numbered by where it fell among that class's lambdas — and that number is javac's answer rather
 * than anything a line of the code says.
 *
 * <p>Addressed by it, a licence fails both ways. A lambda written earlier in the same class moves
 * the number, and the entry goes red for an edit that has nothing to do with who is licensed, which
 * is the licence being edited to match whatever the compiler did. The other way round is quieter: a
 * different lambda that comes to hold that number is licensed by an entry nobody wrote for it, and
 * the check cannot tell the two apart.
 *
 * <p><b>What is forbidden is the identity javac made, and it is taken from javac.</b> Not a
 * spelling: a rule that recognised such a name by its shape would be a second account of how javac
 * names a lambda, which is the same defect this is about one level up — and one that goes wrong at
 * exactly the places a naming scheme is allowed to surprise its readers. So the population is every
 * lambda this repository compiled, under the address a licence writes: the class it was written in,
 * and the name javac gave it.
 *
 * <p><b>What is refused is the identity reaching the licence, and not the lambda.</b> A rule that
 * reads compiled classes meets lambdas wherever it walks, and answering for one by the method it was
 * written in is a reading several rules here already have. What that reading hands back is a name
 * the source states; what is refused here is writing javac's name down as the address instead.
 *
 * <p><b>Asked of every check this repository has.</b> A population taken from the checks that hold a
 * licence would be taken from the property being checked — a list written tomorrow would not be in
 * it — so it is every class compiled beside a test, and the rule is the narrow one.
 *
 * <p>What it does not see, said rather than left to be found. A name put together at run time out of
 * pieces is not something the class file holds as text, so a licence assembled that way would pass;
 * {@link WhatACheckSays} is what a check has written down. And an address of a lambda that no longer
 * exists is not here either, because no such lambda was compiled — an entry like that matches
 * nothing the licence it sits in walks over, and goes red there.
