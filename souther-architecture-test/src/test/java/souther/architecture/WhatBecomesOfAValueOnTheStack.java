/**
 * Where a value one instruction pushed is used, for a rule about how a value is read.
 *
 * <p>A rule that says a constant may not be compared has to say what compares it, and what compares
 * a value is the instruction that takes it off the stack. Read as the instructions written near it,
 * the answer would be about where the source put the comparison and not about the comparison: a
 * constant written where a value is wanted stands beside whatever the method does next, and one
 * compared against something worked out in a conditional stands several jumps away from the
 * comparison that takes it.
 *
 * <p><b>An instruction is what it takes and what it leaves, and never the difference.</b> A call
 * that takes a receiver and returns something leaves the stack the height it found it, and what is
 * on it is not what was on it. Read as a height, {@code EMPTY.name() == text} is a constant that
 * came through a call and reached a comparison; read as what took what, the constant is what the
 * call took, and the comparison is about a string.
 *
 * <p>So what is followed is how far above the value the stack has come. Where that is further than
 * an instruction takes, the value is under everything the instruction is about and comes through
 * it; where it is not, that instruction is what took the value, and what it did with it is the
 * answer.
 *
 * <p><b>What it cannot follow it refuses, and never answers.</b> An instruction whose effect this
 * cannot say, one that takes the value and puts it back somewhere this does not model, a way round
 * that comes back to where the walk has already been, the beginning of an exception handler, and
 * the end of a method with the value still on the stack are each a place the value was lost rather
 * than taken — and every one of them ends the walk with a refusal. Answered, each would come out as
 * "nothing compares it", which is the one thing a rule written on top of this reads as a fact.
 *
 * <p>What it does follow is a value carried across the jumps that work something else out, across a
 * switch, which takes the number it switched on and leaves the value alone, and across a cast,
 * which leaves what it took. Each way the code may go is remembered with the stack it is reached
 * at, and picked up again where it arrives.
