/**
 * Who may ask an account of the rules whether a clause of it went unread.
 *
 * <p>That an alternative is one nothing could read is a fact about the clause somebody wrote.
 * Whether the branch beside it still holds a position down is a fact about what the two branches
 * leave, and the two are not the same question: alternatives narrowing a position the same way
 * narrow it whether or not either could be read to the end. Derived from the first, the second
 * comes out as a rule that is false, and a rule holding a position down is reported as holding it
 * down nowhere.
 *
 * <p>So the answer has one owner. What the branches leave is worked out where they are settled and
 * arrives as an opening ({@code Opening}); an account applies one and works none out. What the flag
 * is still good for is written down below, and a row that is not one of those is a second
 * derivation of one fact.
 *
 * <p>Read off the compiled classes and named down to the method, so that a reader is licensed for
 * the question it asks rather than for the class it happens to sit in. Both ways of reaching the
 * flag count: an accessor called on an account, and the field read straight off it, which is what a
 * class in the same file compiles to.
 *
 * <p><b>The account's own methods are not rows.</b> Composing the flag over a choice is what the
 * flag is for, and every method that carries one reads it. What holds that composition to carrying
 * it and nothing else is a law over the operation
 * ({@code AnOpeningIsAppliedToAnAccountAndNeverDerivedFromItTest}), which this cannot see and which
 * says the part this cannot.
