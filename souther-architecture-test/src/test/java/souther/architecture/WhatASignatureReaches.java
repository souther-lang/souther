/**
 * What the types a signature is written in reach.
 *
 * <p>The closure read from the roots it is given: the types the signature names, the declared upper
 * bounds of the type variables it refers to, and the components of the records it arrives at. A rule
 * about a surface is written against this so that it holds of what a caller can be handed rather
 * than of how the handing was spelled — a clause inside a record is a clause the caller gets, and a
 * world named through a variable is the world the declaration guarantees.
 *
 * <p><b>A bound is read because it is what the declaration guarantees, not because it says what the
 * argument will be.</b> {@code <S extends Symbols>} may be given a derived world and this reading
 * does not say so; what it says is that {@code Symbols} is what every use of {@code S} is warranted
 * to be. That is the same answer to both of the questions a rule asks — whether the declaration
 * guarantees a world arrives here at all, and whether the one it guarantees is the derived one, a
 * question about what is written and never about what a run could pass — so one reading serves both,
 * and
 * a walk bounded only by {@code Symbols} stays loose under the rule that wants the derived world.
 *
 * <p><b>A type parameter is an environment and not a root.</b> A bound is followed when the variable
 * it belongs to is referred to from a root, and not before: a method declaring
 * {@code <S extends DerivedSymbols>} and never writing {@code S} reaches nothing through it.
 *
 * <p><b>What this cannot resolve, it does not call unreachable.</b> A type variable with no binding
 * in scope and a class of this repository with no class file are both questions this reading cannot
 * answer, and both fail it. Answering {@code false} there is the shape of the defect this reading
 * replaced: a spelling nobody had thought of went unread and was reported as reaching nothing.
 *
 * <p>What it does not do is recover what a signature threw away. A raw type, or a parameter written
 * as {@code Object}, names nothing this can follow, and no reading of the signature will say what
 * flows through it. Nor does it substitute the arguments at a use into the components of the record
 * they parameterize: an argument is written where the record is used and is already read there, and
 * a bound is the only thing a signature refers to without spelling it. A question about which
 * component becomes which type would need that substitution and is not one this answers.
