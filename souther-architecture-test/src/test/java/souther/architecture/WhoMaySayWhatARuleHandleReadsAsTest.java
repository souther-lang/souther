/**
 * Who may say what a rule handle reads as, and which fields of the document one is written into.
 *
 * <p>The document says how a reader is sent to a rule in five fields, and the schema says of each
 * that it carries such a handle. What holds those two lists together is a comparison between the
 * schema and {@code RuleHandleSurface} — and that comparison is worth what the surface is worth: if
 * a handle can reach a document field without going through one, the enum is a list of the places
 * somebody remembered, which is the thing this whole issue is about one layer up.
 *
 * <p>So it is read off the compiled classes rather than trusted. Two questions, and neither is
 * answerable by looking at the enum: who renders a handle at all, and which fields are written
 * through it. A renderer reached by a method reference renders as surely as one called here, which
 * is the other reason to read the classes rather than the source.
 *
 * <p>What the rows leave open is deliberate: a class may put whatever string it likes under whatever
 * key. What it cannot do is get a rule handle's words without appearing here.
