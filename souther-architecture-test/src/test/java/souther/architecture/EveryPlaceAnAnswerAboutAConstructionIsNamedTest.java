/**
 * Who may settle what a construction was read as, and where.
 *
 * <p>Two checks beside this one read the caller: nothing outside {@code souther.compiler.ast} hands
 * an origin in, and nothing outside names which of its fields a construction had to write. Both see
 * an answer only where a call site spells one, so a member of the owning package that fills one in
 * for whoever calls it leaves every caller clean — which is what a constructor answering
 * {@code own} was, and what a factory answering {@code optionals may be omitted} would be.
 *
 * <p>What settles an answer is a member and the calls that reach it, so both are read here. The
 * members of the owning package that name an answer are listed, each by the whole of what it is, so
 * a second one of a name is a second row. And the calls that reach the members which <em>settle</em>
 * one are listed by the method that makes them and how many it makes, because a settling member is
 * public and being unable to reach its arguments is a thing about how the passes are written rather
 * than one the language holds.
 *
 * <p>The method rather than the class it is in, because a class holds passes that do different
 * things and a row naming the class says one thing about all of them. How many rather than whether,
 * because a second call beside a first is a second place settling an answer.
 *
 * <p>And nothing outside the package builds one of these forms at all. The list of callers says who
 * reaches a named way in; it says nothing about a pass that reaches past them, and a form here is a
 * record whose constructor answers whatever it is handed. The two are separate checks because they
 * answer different questions — which way in was used, and whether a way in was used.
 *
 * <p>No list here says what a rewrite is. The first is every member of a package, read off its
 * classes; the others are the calls that reach them, read off the whole reactor. A pass added
 * tomorrow is in them or it does not settle an answer.
