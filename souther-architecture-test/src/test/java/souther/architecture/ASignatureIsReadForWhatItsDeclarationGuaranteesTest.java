/**
 * What a reading of a signature answers, held over declarations written here to be read.
 *
 * <p>{@link WhatASignatureReaches} is what the rules about a compiled surface are written against,
 * and the shapes it has to answer for are not shapes this repository writes. Nothing here is
 * declared with a world arriving through a type variable, which is the whole reason a reading that
 * could not see one went unnoticed. So the subjects are declared below and read out of this class's
 * own class file: what javac wrote for a declaration, rather than a signature spelled by hand into
 * a fixture, which would hold of a grammar this test believed in instead of the one there is.
 *
 * <p>Four of these say what the reading means and the rest say that each branch of the two
 * algebras it walks was walked.
